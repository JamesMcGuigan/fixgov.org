          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The
                main issue</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The
              supply of money into the economy, and for what purpose, is the
              main 
  issue which governs all the issues. <br>
  Most people do not realise that the present system is debt-based with 96% 
  of all money being supplied to the economy as a debt to be repaid, with 
  interest, to the banking system. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The
                Great Unmentionable Secret<br>
  Banks create money out of nothing!</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Furthermore,
              when a bank lends, it is not lending other people's savings 
  (already deposited in the bank). Rather the bank is creating a sum to lend
  by 
  just pressing a computer button, i.e., the bank creates money out of nothing
  and 
  then adds interest! This is the Great Unmentionable Secret that the banks are
  hiding. Also being hidden is the fact that governments rely upon the majority
  of people borrowing all the time (and so going into debt) simply to create
   enough money to supply the economy.<br>
  To cap it all, governments, too, borrow from the banking system to fund 
  public expenditure. Taxpayers then have to pay back the principal debt plus
  interest. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>96%
                of the money supply is debt-based and has to pay interest!</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So
              96% of the present money supply (for the needs of individuals,
              the 
  private sector and government) is debt-based and has to pay interest!! Indeed,
  most activity in a modern economy requires interest to be paid to the banking
  system.<br>
  Because of this debt-based economy, the indebtedness of individuals, 
  families, businesses, cities, governments and countries grows daily. <br>
  Exacerbated by IMF and World Bank policy, the world is now in a wholesale debt
  slavery. That slavery, by eternally requiring repayment of principal plus 
  interest (and compound interest), needlessly perpetuates poverty and is 
  ultimately destructive of society, the environment and the planet. The huge
  amount of debt world-wide makes for a situation of gross instability and the
  possibility of a major economic crash. In addition, at present, there are no
  viable solutions to problems such as diminishing tax bases and 
  financial provision for ageing, longer-living populations.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Obfuscation
                and greed</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The
              present debt-based system is the result of intellectual obfuscation, 
  historical practice, and greed. Why should the banking business be given a
  huge 
  advantage - the power to create money for its own profit - which is denied
  to 
  all other businesses?</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Government
                can create all the money</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yet
              the present debt-based system can be changed if people wake up
              to the 
  crucial fact that the banks create money out of nothing and government can
  do 
  the same. Government has an inherent power to create money out of nothing,
  with 
  or without interest, as it chooses. <br>
  Indeed, government can, and should, create all the money.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Plenty
                of money potentially available</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It
              is therefore a complete lie to claim that there is no money to
              fund <br>
  vital public services, private industries, home ownership and social and 
  environmental projects, when money, at source, is created out of nothing. <br>
  Moreover, since money is being created out of nothing, it is also a complete
  lie 
  to claim (as conventional economics does claim) that financial savings are
   needed before there can be investment. The truth is that there is plenty of
  money potentially available if it is created and used for essential purposes
  (which include wide capital ownership) and without causing inflation. (And,
  NB, 
  the major cause of inflation is the interest which, all the time, has to be
  paid 
  to the banking system.)<br>
  So governments should be able to supply money, debt-free, without having 
  to borrow from the banking system. &quot;Debt-free&quot; means that it is interest-free
  and does not have to be repaid. <br>
  However, for the purposes of widely extending the ownership of productive 
  capital and the ownership of homes, the money need only be interest-free and,
  being repaid, cannot be inflationary. The money would come through a private
  bank but because that bank would in effect be acting as a mere conduit for
   interest-free money coming from the government, no interest would be payable. <br>
  The money would, however, still have some charges attached to it, namely, <br>
  i) administration costs <br>
  ii) insurance against loss (or equivalent), perhaps totalling 3% or a little 
  more. <br>
  Private banks will still be able to make, and charge interest on, loans for 
  capital investment which do not result in wider capital ownership.<br>
  With debt-free and interest-free money we can create new societies, build 
  a new world and better carry out our duties to God. Islamic countries, among
  others, will be pleased to notice in particular that no interest is involved.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>We
                further recognise:</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The
                unfree market prevents the wide ownership of productive capital</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In
              practice, 'free market' capitalism (which should be called 'unfree, 
  unfair and inefficient market capitalism') only allows jobs and welfare benefit
  for most people and does not allow them the ownership of substantial amounts
  of 
  productive capital. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#009966" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>An
                independent basic income for all</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So,
              since many people (e.g., unpaid carers) cannot labour and jobs
              are not 
  always available, or are insecure, or badly paid, every individual should also
              have an independent basic income. An element of that income could
              come from
  the 
  redistribution of taxes but, in the main, the income should come <br>
  - from the issuance of debt-free money (being termed 'National Dividend' or
  'pre-distribution' income) and/or<br>
  - using interest-free money, from the ownership of productive capital (being
  termed 'capital income').<br>
  Indeed, since productive capital now creates most of the wealth, all 
  people, if they are to be truly economically productive, must have some 
  ownership of capital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="#009966">Anti-inflation</font></strong><br>
  <br>
  The present system, being debt-based and eternally demanding the 
  payment of ever-increasing amounts of interest, is inflationary. In order to
  curb inflation and promote stable money, a democratically accountable body
   should be established to regulate the supply of money by<br>
  a) deciding the amount of debt-free money to be issued; and<br>
  b) deciding interest rates in the conventional banking sector.<br>
  Broadly, when the amount of debt-free money begins to exceed a 
  certain amount, interest rates and other mechanisms in the conventional banking
  sector would be used to control the overall money supply.<br>
  However, no regulation would be necessary where interest-free money 
  (for wide capital ownership, home ownership and public capital spending) is
  used 
  because it is repayable (and so cancellable). Indeed, the use of interest-free
  money for wide capital ownership hugely increases productive capacity while
  all 
  the money used for the financing is eventually cancelled. The monetary result
  is the opposite of inflation. A new word is required to describe lowered prices
  plus prosperity - perhaps 'doeflation'.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>We affirm:</strong><br>
  <br>
  - Money must be based on the real wealth of society - people, skills, 
  materials and productive capital - not on debt.<br>
  - The supply of money must relate to the physical facts - not to the 
  requirements of the banking system. <br>
  - Money is the means of exchange for goods and services. It is not a 
  commodity in itself.<br>
  - The purpose of an economic system is to provide goods and services - as,
   when and where required - in order to satisfy human needs. <br>
  - Money must be our servant - not our master. <br>
  - Money, at source, is created out of nothing, so there is no need for it to
  be scarce. <br>
  - Whatever is physically possible and socially desirable can be made 
  financially possible.<br>
  - The money system must maximise personal responsibility.<br>
  - The present economic system can, and will be, changed for the better. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Consequently<br>
  We propose:</strong><br>
  <br>
  That the government - via a democratically accountable authority - 
  undertakes the supply of money into circulation as follows:</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#009966"><strong>Debt-free</strong></font><br>
  - To provide a basic income (including pensions, etc.) for every individual.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong><font color="#009966">Interest-free</font></strong><br>
  - To provide a basic income (including pensions, etc.) for every individual 
  through private capital investment by ensuring that each person has a 
  substantial ownership of productive capital and receives the full income 
  there from. This makes producers and consumers the same people as well as 
  balancing supply and demand.<br>
  - To fund start-up and small business.<br>
  - To achieve home ownership (at one half or one third of the present cost).<br>
            <br>
            <strong><font color="#009966">Debt-free or interest-free</font></strong><br>
  - To fund public capital investment.<br>
  - To end National Debt and Third World debt. (A condition of ending Third 
  World debt should be that measures are taken to ensure wide capital 
  ownership.)</font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The government would supply money into circulation as set out above <br>
  while, at the same time, regulating interest rates and using other mechanisms
  in 
  the conventional banking sector.<br>
  Among other things, this will reduce the overall burden of debt, end 
  reliance upon the banking system for money supply, make all individuals 
  economically productive via capital ownership, allow everyone to own their
  homes 
  (without having to pay two/three times the original cost as happens at present),
  and open potential for limitless change.<br>
  However, interest-free money for private capital investment should 
  be allowed only if, at the same time (and on the market principles of binary
  economics) it creates new owners of capital. Those principles include a 
  requirement that every individual in the population should have substantial
  ownership of productive capital and the full income there from, whether or
  not 
  they are able to labour. <br>
  Furthermore, in order to spread capital ownership more widely 
  throughout the population, all estates at death should suffer no Estate or
   Inheritance Tax if, as a result of a gift, a recipient does not acquire an
  excessively large holding. In other words, wealthy persons may leave their
   estates, tax-free, to whomsoever they wish subject to one condition - that
  recipients do not acquire a capital estate larger than some legislatively 
  defined amount.<br>
  In addition, LETS-type schemes should be encouraged so that, should 
  they wish, people may simply barter their time and/or labour.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Implementation of the Grand Unifying Theory will create:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="#009966">Healthy economies and societies in which:</font></strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- All
              individuals attain a sturdy independence becoming economically 
  productive to the extent necessary to satisfy their reasonable needs.<br>
  - There is balanced growth which is also a green growth because<br>
  a) individuals involved in practices destructive of the environment 
  can be given another way to earn, and<br>
  b) the economic efficiency allows for the introduction of more 
  costly, but greener, processes.<br>
  - The economic (and hence social) status of women will be enhanced.<br>
  - There is a solution to poverty.<br>
  - There is a foundation for the ending of National and Third World debt and
  the stimulation of economies and societies no longer in hock to outsiders.<br>
  - Democracy will be deepened because all individuals will have much greater
  control over their daily lives.<br>
  - There is an economic foundation for the voluntary control of population 
  levels.<br>
  - Everywhere exists a practical basis for a new honesty, optimism and 
  generosity of spirit.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>'Free market' supporters will note that:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="#009966">'Free market' capitalism says:</font></strong><br>
  <br>
  a) Private property is good and people should own productive capital.<br>
  b) A true free market exists.<br>
  c) Transactions costs, in their various forms, must be minimised.<br>
  d) People should be able to own their homes.<br>
  e) Public investment should be made as economically as possible.<br>
  f) Private investment should be made as economically as possible.<br>
  g) People should receive income from their capital investment.<br>
  h) The National Debt should be at least diminished if not <br>
  eliminated.<br>
  i) Inflation should be minimised, even eliminated.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="#009966">Concerning the above, Binary Credit ensures that:</font></strong><br>
            <br>
  - a) All individuals come to own substantial amounts of productive capital.<br>
  - b) A true free market will exist. At present there is only an unfree <br>
  market. The most potent markets of all - the productive capital markets - 
  are closed to most people. <br>
  Binary Credit, however, allows all individuals to participate in the 
  markets for productive capital.<br>
  - c) The biggest transaction cost of all - interest - is substantially 
  eliminated.<br>
  - d) People may buy their homes at one half or one third of the present 
  cost.<br>
  - e) The cost of public investment interest (which can double or treble a 
  cost) is mainly eliminated.<br>
  - f) The cost of private investment interest (which can double or treble a
   cost) is mainly eliminated if wide ownership is promoted.<br>
  - g) All individuals receive income from their capital investment.<br>
  - h) The National Debt is considerably diminished and eventually 
  eliminated.<br>
  - i) Inflation is minimised, even eliminated.</font></p>
