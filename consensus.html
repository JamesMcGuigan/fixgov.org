                    - How Our Book Is Written Democratically</strong></font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
                  origin of our online book is quite unusual. Most books have
                  one author, sometimes two, but this book is the product of
                  collaboration by a large number of people in many countries
                  participating in an Internet forum. Defying the adage that
                  the only piece of good writing by committee was the King James
                  Version of the Bible, the members of this forum set out to
                  create a guide for reform of government at all levels from
                  global down to local communities, and especially to counter
                  global control by financial interests at the expense of democratic
                  self-rule.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It
                  all started in August 2000 when author and economist Richard
                  Stimson set up the Internet forum &#8220;FixGov&#8221; for
                  collaborative writing on reform of government. Many of the
                  participants came from another forum called Alternate Culture,
                  and quite a few had responded to an invitation at Blue Ear
                  Forum, largely composed of journalists and writers from around
                  the world.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The
                  purpose was stated on the FixGov home page as follows:</font></p>
            <div align="left">
              <blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&quot;Fixing
                      Government: FixGov aims to promote economic, ecological,
                      and social justice. We are working on a book about government
                      reform and we hope for ideas from many areas of the world. <br>
    The FixGov group exists because all the efforts individuals make for sustainable
    living can be offset by corporate and government decisions. How can local,
    national, and international governments be made answerable to the people
    they govern instead of just the power elites? When major polluters of the
    atmosphere use political muscle to escape environmental controls, what can
    be done by the people who have to breathe the polluted air? When municipal
    sewage dumping or industrial waste fouls water that is vital to human health,
    how can people protect themselves? When large-scale corporate agriculture
    and food processing distribute contaminated food and make consumers unknowing
    guinea pigs for genetic modification, radiation, and dangerous substances,
    how can they be subjected to effective control? <br>
    Join a discussion seeking ways to overcome the corruption that undermines
    public interest throughout the world, overthrowing or blocking democracy
    in some countries, making voting seem futile to many in the US, and secretly
    controlling such UN agencies as WTO, IMF, and the World Bank. <br>
    Please make a strong effort to base your comments on facts and remember to
    respect the comments of others, as your postings will go straight through
    without screening by a moderator.&quot; </em></font></blockquote>

                <div align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some
                    70 people joined in this project, including members from the
                    United States, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Netherlands,
                    Poland, Sweden, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mali, Australia,
                    and possibly other countries (because email addresses do not
                always indicate the country). Messages were exchanged in English.</font></div>
              
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As
                  members contributed their thoughts, a volunteer editor was
                  sought. When nobody offered to take on the task, the founders
                  inquired whether one of the particularly articulate participants,
                  Adriaan Boiten, would be willing to assume the responsibility.
                  He agreed, and in addition created a web site displaying the
                  results of the discussion and links to appropriate sources.
                  That web site can now be found at <strong><a href="http://www.fixgov.com">www.fixgov.com</a></strong> and
                  is maintained by another volunteer, James McGuigan.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At
                  the beginning the discussion on the forum was wide-ranging
                  and random. A difference in emphasis emerged between those
                  whose main concern was developing more democratic structures
                  in existing governmental units and others who saw more hope
                  in small autonomous communities living in harmony with nature
                  and sending representatives to bodies that would work out means
                  of cooperation on a larger scale. Both approaches are reflected
                  in the resulting book. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As
                  editor, Adriaan Boiten defined the major topics around which
                  the discussion continued. Each of the chapters is based on
                  the work of a volunteer who summarized the consensus developed
                  in discussions of the forum on one of the topics. These summaries
                  were disseminated to the entire group, then revised in the
                  light of comments received. Finally, they were embodied in
                  this book, edited jointly by Adriaan Boiten and Richard Stimson.
                  Any royalties received from this work will be used to further
                  the objectives of the forum. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As
                  in any forum, some people participated to a greater degree
                  than others, but all were able to offer their thoughts and
                  comment on the contributions of others. Any objections or disagreements
                  were taken into account when the consensus reports were written.
                  The most extensive work was done by the volunteers who prepared
                  those reports. Their backgrounds are quite diverse.</font></p>

                      Richardson</font></strong>, who reported the consensus
                      for the chapter on &#8220;The Spiritual Basis for Sustainable
                      Living,&#8221; was born in New Jersey, but has been living
                      in Europe since 1986 as a yoga and meditation teacher.
                      In the past five years he has worked in Poland on non-profit
                      projects to spread organic farming in Poland and protect
                      small farmers regarding Poland's pending membership in
                      the European Union. As a member of the Ananda Marga yoga
                      meditation association, founded by P. R. Sarkar (who died
                      in 1990), he made several visits to India, became a monk
                      and an authority on Sarkar&#8217;s concept of Microvita.
                      The organization was banned in India and its members blacklisted
                      for its anti-capitalist, anti-communist socioeconomic philosophy,
                      its anti-corruption stand, and a trumped-up murder charge
                      against Sarkar later dismissed in court. To obtain a visa
                      to enter India he changed his name legally from Richard
                      F. Gauthier and got a new passport as Richard Richardson.
                      He has also been known as Rudreshananda in India, and now
                      has the spiritual name of Viveka. Author of a book and
                      many articles about Microvita, he runs several e-mail lists
                      on various spiritual and scientific topics and can be reached

                      and of A Coalition for Self-Learning, that has recently
                      published the book, &quot;Creating Learning Communities,&quot; which
                      grew out of his 1998 E. F. Schumacher Lecture in which
                      he used homeschooling as an example of the application
                      of chaos, complexity, and gaian theories in the social
                      sphere. In the same lecture he used GrassRoots Organizations
                      (GROs) as subset of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
                      as another example of leaderless, unplanned, undesigned
                      self-organization and speculated that the phenomenal growth
                      and linking of GROs could lead to a radically different
                      form of world governance.</font><br>
