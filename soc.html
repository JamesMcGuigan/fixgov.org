              draft examines how directly democratic organization of society
              can bring people into better harmony with other life on the planet
              while avoiding the damage caused by large-scale exploitation of
              the environment.</strong></font><strong>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based
            on a summary by Bill Ellis in Maine, USA.</font></strong><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some
              of the thoughts presented here were inspired by E. F. Schumacher&#8217;s 1973 book, Small is Beautiful, and the lecture
            Bill Ellis gave before the E. F. Schumacher Society in 1998.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">              Today the people of the world are challenged with unprecedented
                    problems as improper care for the earth's ecological systems
                    threatens the
              planet&#8217;s life support system and has brought us to the brink
              of collapse. At the same time soaring population places increasing
            demands on these fragile and interconnected systems. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">              In addition, technological advances have made human labor forces
                increasingly irrelevant to the production of goods and thus delinked
                from the financial markets. As civilization proceeds from the
                    industrial age into the age of knowledge millions of people
                    may be left behind
            with no means of sustenance. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">              As detailed in previous chapters, the powerful are proceeding
                  down the path of globalization, disregarding the needs of people
                  and
                  the environment while enhancing the fortunes of the few (see
                  Chapter 4). This has resulted in most of the world's wealth
                    being concentrated
                  while many millions of others worldwide suffer from unbearable
                  poverty
            with hardships bordering on deliberate inhumane treatment.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">              Under what some refer to as the &#8220;dominator paradigm&#8221; prevailing
                    over thousands of years, economic needs supercede the natural order
                    of earth needs. Modern attempts to increase food production by the
                    sale and use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides
                    and herbicides, monocropping, and intensive meat production are largely
                    responsible for increasing desertification as a result of worldwide
                    topsoil losses. Since civilization itself is dependent upon the topsoil
                    on which it rests, we are digging the foundation out from under our
            home. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">              Now, inadequately tested bioengineering practices (genetically
                      modified products), saturation of live stock with antibiotics,
                      irradiation,
                      and use of hormones to increase milk production introduce
                      possible new dangers. <br>
              As these problems become more evident, millions of individuals
                      around the world are beginning to question the stability
                      and security of
                      our present systems and join with like-minded others to
                      explore the situation. As a result there is a movement
                      toward the
                      creation of &#8220;sustainable
                      living&#8221; societies based on decentralized financial systems,
                      governance through bioregionalism, and lessening of dependence on
            world trade. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">              Such people are sometimes described as &#8220;inner directed,&#8221; &#8220;cultural
                        creatives&#8221; and/or &#8220;integral culturists.&#8221; They believe
                        that competition is antithetical to sustainable living and insist
                        on cooperation. A turn in the direction of sustainable living requires
                        that society examine its old thought patterns and adopt lifestyles
                        that more nearly fit the needs of today. Although such sustainable
                        local or regional communities tend to be restricted in size, they
                        can be linked with other communities in cooperative networks that
            have unlimited potential.</font></p>

                          multiple paths available
                          to provide for his or her well-being and to influence
                          world affairs. Various members

                                                closer to the
                                                edge of chaos.
                                                It
                                                must welcome
                                                a
                                                degree of
                                                disorder. Democracy since its
                                                modern inception has suffered
                                                from
              its self-guilt of being inefficient.
                                                The Gaian Paradigm sees democracy
                                                in a very
                                                different light.
                                                The seeming
                                                weaknesses of democracy
                                                are its strength. The theories
                                                of Gaia, Chaos, and Complexity
                                                suggest
                                                that
                                                self-organizing on the edge
                                                of chaos is
                                                natural law. It requires
                                                the messy flexibility inherent
            in democracy. </font></p>
