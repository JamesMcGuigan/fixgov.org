          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Today
              America is in the era of a new beginning. In many ways this era
              parallells that of the 1870s and America's transition from an agrarian
              society to an Industrial one. By 1870 the heritage of the Pilgrims
              and the other early colonists was well past. The Daniel Boons and
              the Lewis and Clarks had explored nearly every square mile of this
              great land mass. Conastoga Wagons had carried pioneers and settlers
              to the rich farm lands and back waters of every acre of the midwest.
              New England villages had stabalized, Cattle Ranches were bringing
              wealth, praries had become wheat fields, and America was settling
              in to a homey and prosperous way of life. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But
              a few visionaries, like Horace Mann, saw even more for America.
              They saw in the railroads stretching across the country, in the
              water wheels driving New England mills, in the cotton gins turning
              out bales of cotton in the South, in the steamboats plying the
              rivers and canals, a new beginning for their times. They envisioned
              an industrial age in which factories and mills, banks and corporations
              would lead America into a new age of producing goods and wealth
              -- The Industrial Age. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To
              create this new America simple farm folk, homesteaders, and shop
              owners would have to learn new skills and new lifestyles. They
              would have to surrender the freedom and endless toil in their own
              shops and on their farms to accept a new responsibility to the
              the authority of industry. They would have to give up their lives
              regulated only by the weather and planting seasons to a life controlled
              by the assembly line and the factory whistle. In exchange these
              willing workers would be rewarded with steady salaries that would
              provide them with comfortable homes, material goods beyond their
              fondest dreams, and services to reduce the drudgery of their lives. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To
              bring these new Americans into being, a new education system had
              to be created. Mann, with a few strong supporters, set about to
              invent a new education system. Every community would have its state
              mandated schools. Teachers would be certified by Normal School
              and Schools of Education. Local governments, under state laws,
              would require every future citizen to pass through its school system
              to be made ready to take his or her place in the corporate/factory/industrial
              system. Every child would be trained to meet education standards
              imposed by the government </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The
              success of this education/school/teacher system is well recognized.
              Not only did America become the breadbasket and largest supplier
              of manufactured goods in the world, but, its industrial/military
              complex, also made America the most powerful super power the Earth
              has yet known. The American school system was replicated by every
              advancing country.. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Today
              America, and every nation of its world, face a new age of transition.
              Factories no longer dominate an industrial world. American laborers
              have been replaced by technology, and by cheap overseas workers.
              Today only 3 or 4% of Americans work on assembly lines. Even in
              its best days the industrial society left many Americans behind.
              Breadlines, homeless shelters, and sweat shops have always been
              a part of the industrial scene. Raising a family became the provence
              of women, while men earned a living out of the home. Perhaps even
              more relevant, the concentration on training for jobs suppressed
              people's natural curiosity and the joy of learning for its mere
              satisfaction. </font>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Today's
              new beginning is starting from a very different base from that
              of the 1870s. America, and the world in which it is embedded, are
              at a new level of knowledge. Material wealth, technology, and human
              needs and desires, have created a different milieu for learning.
              A learning system for the future must come from a new understanding
              of why we learn, how we learn, and what we learn. These questions,
              why, how and what we learn, must be answered not only for society
              as a whole, as they were in the 1870s, but also for the person.
              The appreciation and love for life for all individuals is dependent
              on their grasp of knowledge of the world and the world of knowledge. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The
              emerging world is no longer the simple straight forward, father
              goes to work, mother keeps the home, and the children attend school,
              lifestyle. Today's world is more like a complex maze of ever changing
              networks within networks -- interlocked webs of evolution. Communications
              have made it possible for books like this one to be written collectively
              by people living thousands of miles apart and never meeting one
              another face to face. Each person, or node of the networks, is
              simultaneously enmeshed in a myriad of interlinked communities
              and virtual communities. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Parallel
              with the increasing complexity of social relations is the speed
              at which they change. Within the old social/economic/education
              system one could expect to learn enough in school to last for a
              lifetime. The concept of school was that all necessary knoweldge
              was known. The job of the school and the teacher was to transfer
              enough of it on to all students to make them able to obtain and
              hold a job for the rest of their lives. Graduation, from highschool
              or college, was one's passport for a lifetime in the world of work. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Education
              can no longer guarantee a person a secure lifelong place in this
              ever transforming web. It is not enough for schools to pass on
              the educational content needed for a job. The context in which
              that content is used is becoming far more important than the skills
              and knowledge one memorizes in school. </font>
          <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The
                learning system of the future must find ways to help people continually
                prepare for the continually shifting context of their lives. </b></font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Another
              aspect of the ever evolving webs of relationships that humans now
              share is the relationships themselves. Each strand of each person's
              networks of communications is a personal relationship. The days
              of being a cog in the manufacturing system have gone with the passing
              industrial age. Doing one's job on the assembly line or in one's
              cubbyhole assures one of neither a secure job for life nor social
              satisfaction. Society today demands attention to the interaction
              with other people. It is not enough to pass on a completed part
              to the next sage in an assembly line, nor a completed document
              up the chain of command to the next higher echelon. How you pass
              information, to whom you pass it, and your interrelation with that
              interpersonal contact is becoming of prime concern. Not primarily
              for social reasons but more to assure the content of information
              is not distorted in transfer. </font>

              These, the human aspect of our lives, are again emerging from the

              the links become ever weaker, and their importance to the indiviudal

              life for friendship, companionship, and the well being of others.
              The place where we "belong". This is the common definition of "community". </font>

              come in many colors. Often the word is restricted to people living
              in a particular area, and/or people with a common interest. And
              certainly these charateristics help create community solidarity.
              Particularly in the age of instant world wide communications the
              forming of fraternal linking in virtual communities is becoming
              part of our social being. And for ages past humanity’s basic need
              to "belong" has been met, in part at least, by nations, religions,
              and other forms of social relations. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The
              fact is that every person wears a coat of many colors. We are all
              members of many diverse communities. To many people even the family
              is of secondary importance to other communal ties. For far too
              many individuals the gang, the secret society, the cult or super-patriotism
              takes precedence over all other communal ties. If "belonging" is
              not met there, it breaks out in an individual's violence, often
              deadly violence, against coworkers, school mates, or others people.
              If society does not meet the need for belonging and community in
              socially beneficial ways, anti-social communties will rise to meet
              that basic need of humans. The need for community is a universal
              need. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our
              emerging communities differ in many ways from the limited family
              based communties of the past. One important difference is the openness
              and extention of today's communities. The extended-family communities
              of the agrarian age and the industrial age were narrowly confined
              in-groups. Families and confined communities prided themselves
              on their clossness and independence. If these communities did not
              actually compete with one another, they considered their members
              as unique and separate. Ethnic values, celebrations, lifestyles
              and beliefs from outside the group were rejected and disparaged. </font>

              Ecumenicalism is not confined to religious tolerance and understanding.
              Differences in food, dress, ritual, lifestyles and values have
              become a fad. Communities reach out accepting and appreciating
              one another and welcoming the boundless and ever changing values
              of extended community. The web of being is interlocked enclaves

              Horace Mann recognized in 1870, and as modern science is telling
              us more and more clearly today, the earliest years in a human's
              life are the ones in which a person's life patterns are set. Schools
              that lock future citizen away from family, community, society and
              nature no longer meet human or social needs. The radically changing
              society requires citizens who can change with the times. The pattern
              established during and before one's school days determine not only
              what each individual will be, but also what society will be. As
              Mann recognized well, for his age agrarian workers had to be carefully
              prepared to become the operators of the industrial society. Crucial
              to the citizens of the future for our age, is the capacity to change
              and to continue lifelong learning. </font>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What
              we must recognize today is that future citizens must be prerpared
              from their earliest days, and throughout their lives, to be the
              creators of the continually evolving webs of being and to be continually
              evolving and involved in their ever changing communties. The future
              of learning and the future of community are one. "Learning Communities" will
              replace government schools. They will be Learning Communities that
              know how to change with the changing times. They will also be places
              that provide learning opportunities for all of their citizens.
              Libraries, museums, parks, farms, factories, businesses, homes
              and the streets will be the milieu for learning. Learning Communities
              will also be network of learners who see gaining new skills and
              knowledge as their central pupose for being. Providing economic
              material luxuries will become of secondary importance to providing
              the social and cultural well-being. </font>

              directly "Learning Communities" implies communities that are learning,
              evolving and continually moving into new eras. Today this connotation
              of learning communities is most relevant because all of society
              is in a state of transition. The EuroAmerican world evolved in
              the <i>Dominator Paradigm</i>. That is, with a mindset that held
              that the Earth was made for the domination and use of man, and
              that all else women, children, animal, plants and the physical

              That is, a world of interlocked and interdependent systems within
              systems within systems, or holons within holons. This new worldview
              we call the <i>Gaian Paradigm</i>. It conceives of humans as imbedded
              in family, imbedded in community, imbedded in society, imbedded
              in nature. The well-being of each individual depends on the well-being
              of the larger holons in which he is imbedded as well as the small
              holons that are his parts. Of most immediate importance to the
              individual is the family, and community (an extended family). The
              well-being of each of us is dependent on our evolving community.

              related connotation for "learning community" is a community that
              provides life long learning experiences for all its citizens. A
              community in which each individual is recognized and partcipates
              in the evolution of the community. And in which the community recognizes

              Community is one that recognizes, develops, and promotes learning
              opportunities for all of its citizens. Citizens of all ages are
              provided opportunities to increase their skills and their knowledge.
              Future citizens are not locked away in schools separated from family,

              third, and perhaps the most telling, definition of Learning Communities
              is as communities of learners or, more accurately communities of
              self-learners or autodidacts. Self-Learning is almost a tautology.
              We are "Learning All the Time" as John Holt put it. Or as modern
              brain research reveals every input from our senses is sorted by
              a function of the brain and harmonized with our existing memory
              in a single neural network that is distributed throughout the brain.
              This process implies that each brain, that is each learner, is
              a unique holon accepting knowledge in its own unique way. New knowledge
              cannot be forced into a group of different individuals at the same

              person's basic need for "belonging." But more in the terms of forming
              society, learning about others as well as learning with others.
              The learning community is the rock bottom of all we are. It is
              a foundation on which the larger community and society is built. </font>

              has been a rapid increase in grassroots groups taking their own
              learning into their own hands. Learning Circles, Book Clubs, Homeschool
              Support Groups, Learning Libraries, and many other forms of collaborative
              learning have proliferated across America and around the world.
              Civil Society has rapidly become a third leg of governance along

              It will be an age in which economic and material values are subsummed
              by the values of humanity, cooperation, and mutual aid. Creative
              particpation in that evolution will be the mainstay of the future
