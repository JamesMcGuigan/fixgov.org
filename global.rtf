or, sometimes two, but this book is the product of collaboration by a large number of people in many countries participating in an Internet forum.  
\par Defying the adage that the only piece of good writing by committee was the King James Version of the Bible,
 the members of this forum set out to create a guide for reform of government at all levels from global down to local communities. They aimed especially to counter global control by financial interests at the expense of democratic self-rule.
\par It all started in August 2000 when the Internet forum \ldblquote FixGov\rdblquote 
 was set up for collaborative writing on reform of government and continued for over two years, ending with publication early in 2003. Many of the participants came from another forum called Alternate Culture
, and quite a few had responded to an invitation at Blue Ear Forum, largely composed of journalists and writers from around the world.
\par The purpose was stated on the FixGov home page as follows:
\par }{\b0\i Fixing Government: FixGov aims to promote economic, ecological, and social justice. We are working on a book about government reform and we hope for ideas from many areas of the world. 
\par The FixGov group exists because all the efforts individuals make for sustainable living can be offset by corporate and government de
cisions. How can local, national, and international governments be made answerable to the people they govern instead  of  just  the  power  elites?   When  major  polluters  of  the 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0\i \page 
atmosphere use political muscle to escape environmental controls, what can be done by the people who have to breathe the polluted air? When municipal sewage dumping or industrial waste fouls water that is vital to human health, how can people protect them
selves? When large-scale corporate agriculture and food processing distribute contaminated food and make consumers unknowing guinea pigs for genetic modification, radiation, and dangerous substances, how can they be subjected to effective control?

members from the United States, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mali, Australia, and possibly other countries (because email addresses do not always indicate the country). Messages were exchanged i
n English.
\par As members contributed their thoughts, a volunteer editor was sought. When nobody offered to take on the task, the founders inquired whether one of the particularly articulate participants, Adriaan Boiten, would be willing to assume the responsib
ility. He agreed, and in addition created a web site displaying the results of the discussion and links to appropriate sources. That web site can now be found at }{\field\fldedit{\*\fldinst {\b0  HYPERLINK http://www.fixgov.org }{\b0\fs20 {\*\datafield

\par At the beginning the discussion on the forum was wide-ranging and random. A difference in emphasis emerged between those whose main concern was developing more democratic structures in existing governmental units and others
 who saw more hope in small autonomous communities living in harmony with nature and sending representatives to bodies that would work out means of cooperation on a larger scale. Both approaches are reflected in the resulting book.
\par As editor, Adriaan Boite
n defined the major topics around which the discussion continued. Each of the chapters is based on the work of a volunteer who summarized the consensus developed in discussions of the forum on one of the topics. These summaries were disseminated to the en
tire group, then revised in the light of comments received. Finally, they were embodied in this book, edited jointly by Adriaan Boiten and Richard Stimson. Any royalties received from this work will be used to further the objectives of the forum. 
\par As in any
 forum, some people participated to a greater degree than others, but all were able to offer their thoughts and comment on the contributions of others. Any objections or disagreements were taken into account when the consensus reports were written. The mo
st extensive work was done by the volunteers who prepared those reports. Their backgrounds are quite diverse.
\par Adriaan Boiten, co-editor, engaged in historical preservation for the City of Amsterdam for 12 years. He studied new and theoretical history at the
 Municipal University, co-editor, is the proprietor of a web design business in Amsterdam, previously having been of Amsterdam, graduating in 1986, and performed civic service in the library of the International Institute of Social History in lieu of mili
tary service.
\par Richard Stimson, co-editor, is an author and retired business professor in High Point, North Carolina, serving voluntarily as national coordinator of the worldwide International Simultaneous Policy Organisation.  Educated at Yale, Florida Inte
rnational University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, his careers have spanned association management, public relations, university teaching, and computer operations.  
\par James McGuigan, webmaster of www.fixgov.org, is a draftsman and information technology (IT) manager at his family\rquote 
s woodworking business in West Sussex, UK. After studying English and business at Hubbard College, he is now working towards a degree in computer science with the Open University. 
\par James Hall, summarizer of t
he consensus on political systems, grew up in a family of Republicans, supported Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign and the Vietnam war, but gradually migrated to a liberal viewpoint.  A long-time resident of Orlando, Florida, he worked 23 years for 
t
he Walt Disney Company in jobs from ride operator to technical writer. In the Transportation/Communications Union at Disney, he served as a shop steward, district trustee, and finally as President and Treasurer, representing the interests of 3,000 Disney 
employees. He also was a writer and editor of the union\rquote s district newsletter for nine years. With a master\rquote 
s degree in liberal studies, he has taught at community college, written for The American Partisan and several other web magazines, and is collaborating on a book with Ian Foster.
\par Liane Casten, who (with Stimson) assembled most of the material in the chapter on communications media, is an author, journalist, film writer and director. Presently she is co-founder and president of Chicago Media Watch, a v
olunteer watchdog group that monitors the media for bias, distortions and omissions, and she is working on her second book, an expos\'e9 of a criminal corporation, scheduled for publication in 2002. Her first book, }{\b0\i 
Breast Cancer: Poisons, Profits and Prevention}{\b0  (Common Courage Press, 1996), grew out of a cover story in }{\b0\i Ms}{\b0 . on the environmental connection to the disease. Her articles have also been published in }{\b0\i 
E Magazine, The Nation, Mother Jones, Environment Health Perspectives, In These Times, Business Ethics, The Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times. }{\b0 
She wrote and directed four documentary films. With an M.A. from the University of Chicago, she has also taught high school and college classes.
\par Richard Richardson, who reported the consensus for the chapter on \ldblquote The Spiritual Basis for Sustainable Living,\rdblquote 
 was born in New Jersey, but has been living in Europe since 1986 as a yoga and meditation teacher. In the past five years he has worked in Poland on non-profit projects to spread organic farming in Poland 
and protect small farmers regarding Poland's pending membership in the European Union. As a member of the Ananda Marga yoga meditation association, founded by P. R. Sarkar (who died in 1990), he made several visits to India, became a monk and an authority
 on Sarkar\rquote 
s concept of Microvita. The organization was banned in India and its members blacklisted for its anti-capitalist, anti-communist socioeconomic philosophy, its anti-corruption stand, and a trumped-up murder charge against Sarkar later dismissed in
 court. To obtain a visa to enter India he changed his name legally from Richard F. Gauthier and got a new passport as Richard Richardson. He has also been known as Rudreshananda in India, and now has the spiritual name of Viveka. Author of a book and man

\par Global communication is 
good; global monopoly is bad. Worrying about global problems may seem unnecessary to those among us who are fortunate enough to be living in a democracy during a period of history that lacks many of the horrors of the past. Human sacrifice, cannibalism, s
lavery, colonial oppression, and many diseases are largely (but not entirely) behind us, as are two world wars, and it is right to be thankful for the benefits we have.
\par Laborsaving inventions of the Industrial Revolution have saved many of us from the backb
reaking tasks of earlier times. The electronic age has made it possible to exchange information and ideas rapidly around the globe. Most innovation (although aided by government-funded research and sometimes subsidies) has been introduced to the public by
 private enterprise. 
\par Yet there are serious problems, especially as the means now exist to destroy all humans on the planet, possibly by global climate change and certainly with weapons of mass destruction. Too often governments act in concert with armament
s manufacturers to promote the sale of weapons of war, sometimes to both sides in a conflict. As an example, the foreign aid budget of the United States currently includes many times as much \ldblquote military aid\rdblquote  as peaceful grants.
\par In the movement for sustainabl
e development, groups of people have tried to escape from multinational corporate tyranny by forming self-sustaining communities, often drawing on the wisdom of indigenous cultures. These efforts for sustainable living, however, can be offset by corporate
 and government decisions, as in the case of native populations driven off their lands by mining and drilling operations that poisoned their water supplies and crops.
\par \page As the world becomes more interconnected, the reins of control are found in fewer hands and most people discover they have less control over their lives. History has known centralized power before, but the rise of democracy in the 19}{\b0\super th}{
\b0  and 20}{\b0\super th}{\b0  centuries raised the hope of greater personal freedom under governments answerable to their citizenry. 
\par Now this has often degenerated into what some call pseudo-democracy. Many people feel their choice in voting is between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and so there are widespread protests and demonstrations, including some elements that become violent. Eve
n some outbreaks of terrorism have their roots in the despair of people who have lost hope in peaceful solutions.
\par The tribal rivalries and centuries-old feuds between ancient enemies are made worse by irresponsible divide-and-conquer tactics of the great p
owers and marketing of armaments to both sides in each dispute, including proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction.
\par When the most powerful people in the world come together in official economic conferences (G-8, IM
F, WTO, etc.) and such unofficial groups as the Bilderberg, the Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations, they remain in splendid isolation from the less powerful people. After a series of protest demonstrations at major cities, they ha
ve recently held their official meetings behind strong barricades and heavily armed police forces and/or at isolated locations. 
\par The emphasis is on economic growth, but the measures they use are badly flawed. Gross domestic product (GDP) is based entirely on money transactions, thus missing the value of housework, home cooking, child raising, do-it-yourself work at home, 
\ldblquote sweat equity,\rdblquote  and all forms of voluntary service. Robert Eisner\rquote s 1994 book, }{\b0\i The}{\b0  }{\b0\i Misunderstood Economy}{\b0 , asked: \ldblquote If restaurant meals are s
ubstituted for home cooking, is that an increase in product?\rdblquote 
 He estimated conservatively that if the value of unpaid labor services in the home were included the 1992 U.S. GDP would have been $8 trillion instead of $6 trillion. On the other hand, GDP igno
res economic harm done to nature and to the health of individuals. 
\par  Prominent at these meetings are top bankers, financiers, corporate executives, media owners, and politicians. Hardly ever present are labor leaders, consumer representatives, or environme
ntalists. Secrecy results in rumors of plots for world control that are sometimes wild and sometimes not totally outlandish. 
\par There are indications that the globalization moves and \ldblquote neo-liberal\rdblquote  economics of these organizations have led to increasing dispa
rity of wealth and income both within and between nations. In short, it is held that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. Details of this disparity in wealth and income are given in Chapter 4. 
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 A June 2002 report of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on the poverty trap of less developed countries investigated \ldblquote 
whether the current form of globalization is tightening the poverty trap and also increasing the vulnerabilities of those countries that appear to be escaping it.\rdblquote  The answer was, in effect, \ldblquote Yes.\rdblquote 
 The report, however, stopped s}{\b0 hort of admitting that World Bank, IMF, etc., are collaborating with multinational corporations to bring about the impoverishment described in the report. }{\b0\cgrid0 (}{\field\flddirty{\*\fldinst {\b0\cgrid0

\par This chapter notes the spread of democratic elections as the basis for governance in more countries of the world, although imperfections exist even in the best of democracies. The forces th
at concentrate wealth and power into a few hands, and that abuse the earth's environment for their own benefit, also oppose democratic reforms, social justice, human rights, and efforts to create a sustainable local economy. Ways of overcoming these obsta
cles and furthering genuine democracy are discussed. A \ldblquote security state\rdblquote  of the closed, fundamentalist and ruthless variety is not the solution for public fears and needs generated by terrorism.
\par  Although many people would like to conduct their personal, fam
ily, and community lives without interference from government, that is not the way it is. Even remote parts of the world are coming under political control, often combined with invasion by economic power. Thus traditional cultures in areas as widespread a
s
 Nigeria, Brazil, Papua New Guinea, and elsewhere are being driven off their land by the combined actions of governments and foreign exploiting industries, including cyanide or oil spills in their streams, destruction of their crops, and repressive police
 action.
\par There is a legitimate difference of opinion as to how much or little government is desirable, but the alternative to government\emdash anarchy\emdash 
has not been demonstrated to work well in a world where greed overpowers goodwill. That makes it important what 
kind of government we have. Anarchy requires an educated and empowered independent public to work properly. It is never in the best interests of hierarchies to allow these conditions to exist in reality. 
\par Although it is often far from perfect in practice, 
democracy operates on the principle that no leader can be trusted to know what people need and want better than the people themselves. It aims to meet the desires of the majority without being unfair to minorities.
\par Those who are lucky live in one of the wo
rld's liberal democracies where generally (if not perfectly) leaders are elected by popular vote and human rights are honored. Since 1950, the world has seen a phenomenal growth of democracies, from 22 nations representing 31% of the world's population, t
o 120 electoral democracies representing 58% of the world's people. 
\par That's a shift of historic importance, but it's not enough. Seventy-two sovereign nations representing 42% of the world's people still have no representative government. In such nations, w
orking for democracy is an important first step towards creating social justice and a sustainable world economy. Some countries may have a democratically elected government, but few recognized human rights, and in some democracy and human rights may rest 
on fragile foundations. 
\par Even members of long-established democracies can't rest but must work hard to keep elections honest and citizens\rquote  rights from being abused. There are powerful interests that benefit from restricting human rights and corrupting democ
ratic institutions. 
\par There was a time, perhaps, when politics was a noble statecraft, and politicians were regarded in high esteem.  Politics was not their profession; they came from various respectable professional backgrounds; such as lawyers, physicians
, teachers, landlords etc. Politicians belonging to a party believed in the ideology for which the party stood,   and  dedicated  themselves  in 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page fulfilling the party objectives. Today politics is a full time profession to most politicians.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0  The forces th
at concentrate wealth and power into a few hands and that abuse the earth's environment for their own benefit oppose democratic reforms, social justice, human rights, and efforts to create a sustainable local economy. Their goal is to block genuine democr
atic institutions, manipulate elections, limit human rights, and use the environment for their shortsighted interest\emdash to gain wealth and hold onto power.
\par A good citizen's political work is never done, and he or she must be vigilant both to create a better wo
rld and to sustain it. Corruption can occur both in the electoral process and in unfair influencing of public officials that amounts to bribery although not always illegal.
\par For example, }{\b0\i The Buying of Congress}{\b0  by Charles Lewis and the Center for Public Inte
grity (Avon Books, 1998) reports that in the United States thousands die and millions become ill from poisoned foods. Meanwhile Congress has blocked tougher safety standards and received $40 million campaign donations in ten years from the food industry. 

\par Also, members of Congress received $180 million from the 500 largest corporations and cut corporate income tax rates to provide only 10% of all federal revenue compared with 28% in 1956. With great difficulty a bill was passed in 2002 that will make a sta
rt on campaign finance reform after the November 2002 elections.
\par The light of world public opinion has brought about honest elections in many countries for the first time with the help in some cases of United Nations monitors and in other cases of impartial international observers organized by former U.S. president Jim
my Carter.
\par \page Any nation dominated by just one party fails to function as a democratic system. Some regimes try to give the appearance of democracy, but if only one party is permitted, the elections are mere window-dressing. The same is true in a two-party sy
stem when the same powerful interests largely control both parties. New parties should not face unreasonable requirements to get on the ballot. Legitimate voters should not be hindered and fraudulent voting should be prevented.
\par The method of recording and 
counting votes varies among democratic countries, and there are advocates for each system. Balloting methods range from paper ballots marked with party symbols for the illiterate to high-tech mechanical or electronic voting machines. Honest counts require
 that there be a way to recheck the votes, so paper ballots must be safeguarded and machine tallies must preserve an audit trail so that totals can be checked against individual votes.
\par Some elections are conducted on a \ldblquote winner-take-all\rdblquote  basis where the cand
idate with the most votes in his or her district is elected. An alternative is proportional representation where each party gets the number of seats in a representative body that is in proportion to the votes it got in the election. In some jurisdictions,
 if a candidate fails to receive a majority of the votes cast, a run-off election is held between the two highest scoring candidates. Preference voting, or \ldblquote instant run-off,\rdblquote 
 is sometimes used where voters record first, second, and maybe third choices, for example, which are counted in order until someone has a majority.
\par The U.S. presidential election involves an indirect method in which members of an \ldblquote Electoral College\rdblquote  are chosen on the basis of whom they are pledged to support and then they choose the pre
sident (and vice president). Most states allocate all their electoral votes to the party that scored highest. Usually this results in  choosing  a  president  who  also  received  the  highest national

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Variations in these methods can be quite acceptable, so long as they are approved by those governed and reflect the will of the people. Choices made by politici
ans, however, often suit their own personal and party interests. One of their tricks is to lay out districts (constituencies) for party advantage. This is called \ldblquote gerrymandering\rdblquote 
 for an American politician named Gerry who mapped a district in the shape of a salamander.
\par Officials, once elected, can be subverted in various ways. Corporations increasingly are using favors to politicians in ways that are tantamount to bribes, although they may not meet the legal definition of a crime. Even judges receive benefi
ts that interfere with their objectivity. Corporations in the United States, and organizations heavily financed by them, have entertained at least 600 federal judges at luxury resort locations for seminars where they are exposed to propaganda for a pro-bu
siness movement called Law and Economics.
\par Corporations have also spent millions to sponsor research and endow professorships reinforcing their points of view in law schools and other areas of academic study, notably including economics. Since the creation o
f NAFTA and WTO (see Chapter 3), they have used clauses banning trade restrictions to sue against national and local laws designed to protect health, safety, and the environment. Through the World Bank and IMF (see Chapters 3 and 4) they have obtained con
trol of government-owned telephone systems, water supplies, and other public utilities, to privatize them for private profit, as well as drilling and mining to the detriment of local farmers and fishermen.

s people. Any higher level of government needs to be carefully limited in its scope and kept under democratic control to preclude the creation of a global tyranny.
\par A further problem that complicates efforts for worldwide peace and freedom is the desire of some groups to establish a separate national homeland. This involves taking over la
nd occupied by someone else and/or seceding from an existing government that usually wants to keep control. Hostilities can result with participants being labeled \ldblquote freedom fighters\rdblquote  by one side and \ldblquote terrorists\rdblquote 
 by the other. Under ideal conditions, each na
tion would be inhabited only by people who willingly consent to being under the government, which in turn would guarantee the rights and freedom of all. That is obviously a very long-term objective, but taking steps in that direction is imperative, both f
or the good of the contenders and for the welfare of the whole world in the context of weapons of mass destruction.
\par Despite general agreement on most of the points in this chapter, there are some people who feel that political systems are so corrupt that it
 is useless to vote. They prefer to arrange their own lives in a way they think will be beneficial to people and the environment and to encourage others to do likewise.
\par Voting percentages have declined sharply in many countries, partly because of a cynical feeling that \ldblquote my vote won\rquote t make any difference,\rdblquote 
 and partly because commercial media have encouraged later generations to focus on entertainment, trivia, and self-gratification. In a few countries, voting is legally required. This, it can be argued, is a
n invasion of freedom. If voting is to enable everyone to make choices, it should include the choice of not voting. Some have suggested a choice on the ballot should be \ldblquote none of the above\rdblquote 
 with the election to be declared invalid if that choice wins.
\par While
 some believe that progress lies in adopting different lifestyles and community organizations (which can certainly be beneficial), the freedom to pursue these and other personal choices seems to require reform of the powerful structures that limit freedom
. The many sacrifices of those who died to replace despotism with democracy, and the eagerness of newly enfranchised citizens of former tyrannies to exercise their voting rights despite all obstacles, are arguments against abandoning one\rquote 
s right to vote.

obal domination by corporate cartels has had detrimental effects on both the more powerful and less powerful countries. Arms sales have fueled internal warfare in less developed countries. The destruction of indigenous environments plus concentration of u

d countries have been overrun by immigrants, often seeking asylum, cultural clashes and competition for jobs have had their effects. For example, European social-democratic or center-left governments, which have been under pressure from private business t

\par Immigration and integration a
re now at the top of the political agenda in Europe, which is sad for all those who are engaged in rational discussions. There are real social and economic reasons for existing tensions, but culture becomes more or less the platform on which people can ex
press their frustrations and emotions, feeling patriotic.
\par  New opposition arises to parties that are seen to be patronizing, arrogant, bureaucratic, and \ldblquote politically correct.\rdblquote  Voters turn to parties that promise action on the new issues that concern them, s

\par The compensation of chief executive officers of these corporations (CEOs) in the United States by 2001 averaged 531 times that of blue-collar workers compared with

Multinational Monitor}{\b0 , Oct. 2001, p. 4).
\par Some, but not all, of the world\rquote s wealthiest people are CEOs\emdash 
others exert their control behind the scenes as major stockholders or financial backers. Corporate management, directors, investment advisors, stockbrokers, bankers, lawyers, and account
ants are supposed to be looking after the interests of the stockholders. Often they seem to be more concerned with personal profits to be made from trading in and out, fees, commissions, stock options, and all the other gimmicks for their own benefit. The

 "scratch each others backs" and "one hand washes another." Ordinary investors are lucky to have their interests get any consideration. Their ownership through mutual funds and/or pension plans is routinely used by the trustees (without consulting them) t
o rubber-stamp management proposals.
\par Extreme abuses in some corporations came to light in 2002, when one of the world\rquote s biggest accounting firms, Arthur Andersen, was convicted of obstruction of justice in the case of Enron. This involved one of the world\rquote s
 largest corporations where members of top management walked away with millions of dollars from the company plus large profits from selling Enron stock before declaring bankruptcy. 
\par The Andersen firm provided advice to set up undisclosed partnerships for hiding corporate losses, and simultaneously served as auditors to verify the reliability of the company\rquote 
s financial reports. Employee pension funds invested in Enron stock were almost completely wiped out, as was the value of stock bought by small investors trusting financial analysts and stock brokers.
\par Although Enron had been rated at or near the top of all corporations based on the market value of its stock, it owned very few physical assets. It was described as an energy trader, and its manipulations were
 discovered to have been behind the electric power crisis in California. Other activities included buying public utilities, including water supply services, from governments around the world at bargain prices and then jacking up the rates to customers of 
the privatized monopoly. It was among the largest donors of campaign contributions to politicians\emdash tantamount to bribes, if not legally so defined. 
\par \page While investigations and litigation involving Enron were still going on, another Arthur Anderson client, Wor
ldCom, disclosed the largest corporate overstatement of cash flow in history, amounting to more than $3.8 billion in the previous 15 months, using a series of accounting tricks to hide expenses and inflate cash flow. The company\rquote 
s CEO owed the company more than $366 million for loans and loan guarantees when he abruptly resigned, the stock that had sold for $62 dropped to about 9 cents, and 17,000 workers are to lose their jobs. 
\par Only a week earlier, executives of Rite Aid, a drug store chain, were indicted, having run up a record overstatement of profits totaling $2.3 billion over two years. This company\rquote 
s auditor was another large accounting firm, KPMG. Other current corporate scandals include Global Crossing (an Andersen client) and Tyco. Merrill Lynch an
d other brokerage firms were found to have been urging customers to buy stock in such companies that the analysts knew were in trouble.
\par Multinational corporations have close ties to major financial houses, which will be discussed further in the next chapter. Directors of banks, investment companies, and other corporations serve on each other\rquote 
s boards and they or their representatives are appointed official advisors to governments. They employ former government officials as lobbyists, who then may return to prominent government positions in a process sometimes known as the \ldblquote 
revolving door.\rdblquote  Armament companies put retired generals and admirals on their boards of directors, while top executives move in an out of high-level government jobs.
\par Those munitions manufacturers, preferring to be called \ldblquote defense industries,\rdblquote 
 also are major financial supporters of politicians, resulting in getting not only government contracts but also subsidies and help in selling their products to foreign countries.  A report by the Congressional Research Service in 2000

Aside from threats of nuclear war and terrorist attacks, the major challenge to democracy and human progress involves the domination by corporations of the institutions of self-government, which is made more difficult when
 the corporations are actually bigger than the national governments. Democracy has always had an uphill fight against various forms of tyranny, whether absolute monarchies or military dictatorships.
\par Through concentrated corporate control of the information
 media, as well as corporate favors and campaign financing to politicians, the rulers of big corporations tend to get their way most of the time. On the world scene, global corporations (including global bankers and financial companies) dominate internati
onal agencies unrestrained by democratic safeguards.
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 A network of faceless bureaucracies, the most familiar of which are the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), make no pretense of being democratic and 
are dominated by representatives from large transnational corporations and banks. 
\par Already, both the USA and the European Union (EU) have been compelled by the WTO to annul various of their health and environmental laws. Most of the third world has been fo
rced to adopt entire legislative agendas dictated by the IMF under what are called "free trade" treaties, and under conditions which are attached to loans given to third-world countries by the regime's agencies. 
\par }{\b0 The governments, in some cases, have made deals with multinational    corporations   to   share   in   profits   from   mining 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page operations that drive native populations off their lands either by using military force or by contaminating their sources of livelihood, resulting in cities crowded with 
unemployed, homeless adults and children. 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Under pressure from 
the global bankers to attract foreign investors, governments have suppressed labor unions and held down wages, benefits, and labor standards. They have given special tax breaks to foreign corporations and relaxed environmental regulation. Recently they ha
ve been required to raise water prices and then sell government water utilities to private monopolies (\ldblquote Privatization Tidal Wave: IMF/World Bank Water Policies and the Price Paid by the Poor\rdblquote  by Sara Grusky, }{\b0\i 
Multinational Monitor}{\b0 , Sept. 2001).
\par Nations have also allowed misuse of patent laws. Corporations send representatives, sometimes called \ldblquote bio-pirates,\rdblquote 
 to learn from indigenous people about natural remedies. Then the companies apply for patents to turn these remedies into profitable monopolies. Patents have even been awarded for genes and other natural phenomena that corporations have identified or 
\ldblquote discovered\rdblquote  in their laboratories.
\par A study of World Bank and IMF loan documents with 26 countries shows that they require privatizing of government-owned ente
rprises, layoffs of government employees, easing of rules on firings and working conditions, increasing the wage gap between employees and managers, and cutting pensions for workers. 
\par For example, the World Bank recommended to Vicente Fox when his new government came into power in Mexico that there be a phase-out of severance payments, collective bargaining, enforceable labor contracts, seniority rules, and liability for subcontractors
\rquote  employees. It also has stated that it cannot support workers\rquote  freedom of association and right to collective bargaining. (\ldblquote Against the Workers: How IMF and World Bank Policies Undermine Labor Power and Rights\rdblquote 
 by Vincent Lloyd and Robert Weissman, }{\b0\i Multinational Monitor}{\b0 , Sept. 2001.) 
\par A few examples from around the world will 
illustrate the unfortunate results. In Haiti, after the military dictatorship was removed from power and the elected president Aristide returned with U.S. help, the IMF, the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Inter-American
 Development Bank offered to help Haiti rebuild. However, the economic program they imposed was the so-called "neo-liberal" structural adjustment that bankers have favored around the world. 
\par Similar plans forced on Haiti\rquote s neighbors\emdash Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela\emdash 
were supposed to reduce poverty and external debts. Instead they widened the income gap, increased poverty, and undermined national sovereignty. These conditions involved privatization of state-owned industries, deregulation of the economy, and op
ening the country to massive foreign investment.
\par Costa Rica has long been known as one of the most democratic of Latin American countries, with less of an income gap than its neighbors. The IMF and the World Bank have begun to change this, ostensibly to pa
y off foreign debt. Thousands of small farmers have been displaced in favor of large agricultural export operations. Increasing crime and violence have resulted in higher police costs, and the country now imports its basic food requirements. Although fore
ign debt has doubled, Costa Rica has been able to meet its debt service payments, so the IMF and the World Bank call it a success story.
\par The World Bank, which awarded Mexico 13 structural and sectoral adjustment loans between 1980 and 1991, imposed the foll
owing conditions on its 1991 agricultural loan: slashing tariffs, canceling  price  controls  on  basic  foods,  privatizing state-owned 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page monopolies, and eliminating price guarantees for corn\emdash the mainstay of the rural poor.

ique, a Cold War hot spot where rebel forces backed by apartheid South Africa and right-wing U.S. business with covert U.S. government approval fought the left-wing movement that took over the government after Portugal pulled out. The U.S. forced Mozambiq
ue to join the IMF and World Bank in 1984, which resulted in World Bank-mandated "structural adjustment" in 1987, and an IMF-controlled stabilization" in 1990.
\par The World Bank used many loans in the 1950s in an effort to win India away from policies of build
ing local production to displace imports and of government intervention in the economy. Large-scale development projects have displaced 20 million people over a 40-year period. After the World Bank withheld $750 million in Indian energy loans to enforce c
ompliance with its opposition to the government program for electrification in rural areas, the Indian government scaled back alternative energy subsidies and power projects in its poorest states. 
\par The fastest growing component of the World Bank is now the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) which loans directly to private companies, including multinational corporations, such as Chase, Citibank, Sumitomo Bank, New York Life, DuPont, Daimler-Chrysler, Electricite de France, Portugal Telecom, Shell, etc. 
Simultaneously, governments are pressured to turn over public utilities to such private companies. (\ldblquote Dubious Development: The World Bank\rquote s Foray Into Private Sector Investment\rdblquote  by Charlie Cray, }{\b0\i Multinational Monitor}{

Corporations and their government allies in all three NAFTA countries vehemently opposed setting up institutions with strong monitoring and enforcement powers.\rdblquote 
 They had their way, as no budget was provided for enforcement. A proposed expansion of NAFTA to the whole Western Hemisphere as Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) seems likely to offer the same empty promises.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 
The European Community or European Union (EU), on the other hand consists of nations that are much more concerned about preventing the exploitation of labor and the environment than the NAFTA countries have been. National laws and EU rules
, such as the Social Chapter, provide a framework within which corporations must operate, however grudgingly. The biggest corporations and political parties friendly to them keep trying to relax such rules.
\par One of the first attempts to bring corporations u
nder control occurred in Europe on May 30, 2002, according to a news release issued by Richard Howitt, European Parliament Rapporteur (Spokesperson) on Corporate Social Responsibility. The European Parliament in Brussels voted for new legislation to requi

 abuses in developing countries.
\par In Europe social-democratic parties have been trying a \ldblquote Third Way\rdblquote 
 between corporate freedom and social responsibility. They set out to reform the welfare state, sometimes (as in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France)  together with moderate Liberal 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page politicians (that is, in European terminology, those favoring corporate freedom).
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 This led to great disenchantment among the population, who saw private wealth grow while public wealth and security dwindled. European people want to be protected against overwhelming ec
onomic power by a social-democratic state, but the politicians weakened government in favor of the market.
\par Paradoxically, the extreme right-wing politicians in Europe, who want a strong state to close the borders against immigrants and proclaim jingoistic 
values, now tend to be the only parties giving people some sense of active government. Corporate power over the people--without responsible social government--leads not only to despair and terrorism in the Third World, but also to a boost for political fa
scism in Europe.
\par People feel helpless against the economy and seek for scapegoats for their disenchantment, rising crime, and economic volatility. There is a grave danger now of a link between private corporate power and the emerging extreme-right parties. 
These parties blame the usual scapegoats, such as immigrants and Jews for social problems actually due to global oligarchy and thus shift attention away from the real causes.
\par Franklin D. Roosevelt said: "The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people
 tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a group or any controlling private power."
\par Instead of listening t
o the people, European Social Democrats, like corporations, have relied on marketing techniques to sell their policies. They are now paying the price for leaving Europe open to uncontrolled corporate power and unreformed globalization. It is in the intere

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Apart from corporate domination of many aspects of government, the structure 
of the work environment imposed by large corporations has serious effects on family and community life. The past few decades have seen changes that reduce the time people have for activities outside the workplace environment, although taking different for
m in three areas: the United States, Europe, and less developed areas. 
\par The expansion of work by women outside the home has been widespread. To the extent it represents more options open to women this can be counted as progress. However, for many women the 
option of remaining at home to care for children has largely been foreclosed by economic necessity.
\par Longer working hours have been required by employers where unions and government protections are weak, particularly in the sweatshops of less developed coun
tries, where people have been forced off their land to form a labor pool in the cities and where child labor is common. Employers in the United States extend the hours in some jobs to avoid hiring additional workers, which would entail the cost of fringe 
benefits such as health insurance, pension plans, unemployment insurance, etc. Conversely, employers make some other jobs part time\emdash often about 37 hours per week\emdash 
to avoid coverage for fringe benefits, but workers have to take more than one job to survive. Europe has been less affected, so far, by the trend for long hours, due to relatively stronger labor unions.
\par In most countries, including the U.S., corporations and their controlling stockholders tend to dominate politics despite any laws intended to preven
t it. Corporations generally enjoy a favored status   in  the  courts  where  they  have  the  privileges  of  natural 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page persons without the responsibilities. The limited liability of corporations allows their officers to escape financial and personal resp
onsibility in many improper schemes such as the Enron scandal (where the final outcome for officers of the corporation and its auditors is yet to be seen). It is common for top officials to get reimbursement from the company for legal expense and fines wh
enever they are taken to court for their actions.

\par }{\b0\cgrid0 As governments began to abandon enforcement of antitrust laws, mergers and acquisitions placed more and more of the world\rquote 
s economy in fewer hands. Economies of scale are usually given as the reason for business combinations.  For any business, efficiency tends to increase with size up to some point.  Often this is interpreted as "the bigger the better."  Ho
wever, large units are not always more efficient, because the disadvantages of bureaucracy exist in private enterprise as well as government.
\par Many studies have shown that relatively small companies produce more innovation, new products, and new jobs than t
he giant corporations.  The motivation for mergers and acquisitions, therefore, is more often a desire for market control than efficiency. Another motive, of course, has been the opportunity for windfalls to top management as well as Wall Street lawyers a

declared in that book: "It is to prevent reduction of price...by restraining free competition...that all corporations, and the greater part of corporation laws, have been established." 
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 The assumptions of classical economics on the Adam Smith model are seriously violated by Wal-Mart, which has become the world\rquote s largest corporation, surpassing ExxonMobil. In the }{\b0\i\cgrid0 Hightower Lowdown}{\b0\cgrid0

\par  8. Corporations can divide themselves, shedding subsidiaries or affiliates that are controversial, have brought them negative publicity, or pose liability threats.

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 
\par THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS WERE SUBMITTED TO THE FORUM MEMBERS AS A SUMMARY OF THOSE ON WHICH ALL WERE THOUGHT TO AGREE:
\par }{ 
\par }{\b0 \page 1. Corporations, espec
ially the multinationals (also called transnationals), must be brought under control. They have extended their size and power to the point that they are a threat to the planet and its inhabitants. Some corporations are actually bigger than many national g
o
vernments in the world. They are able to get free of environmental regulation by threatening governments that they will move to a more permissive jurisdiction. They undermine and destroy labor unions by similar threats or actual movement of factories to a
reas of low or non-existent standards for wages, health, and safety.
\par 2. Remove the legal fiction that a corporation is a person. Given that there are important differences between corporations and real people, corporations should not be awarded the rights o
f free speech and political activity that properly belong to citizens. 
\par 3.Improper influence on government officials must be prevented. Outright bribery is used in some countries. Elsewhere, large corporations and their wealthy controlling stockholders inf
luence public officials by campaign contributions and by favors such as expense-paid trips to luxury resorts, interest-free loans, and free use of corporate jet planes. They also underwrite propaganda campaigns to help political parties and candidates. To
 circumvent election laws in the US they stop short of saying \ldblquote vote for X\rdblquote  or \ldblquote vote against Y\rdblquote 
 but come as close to that as possible. Although it is illegal for corporations to contribute to political campaigns, they seem to have done so by various loopholes and subterfuges.
\par 4. Newspapers and broadcasters need to be freed from the control of corporate cartels. }{\b0\cgrid0 Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 there has been a parade of media mergers and over 4,000 radio stations have been bought up in the United Sta
tes, while television networks are now in the hands of huge corporations like General Electric, Viacom, Disney, and Rupert Murdoch\rquote 
s News Corporation. Murdoch also controls large portions of the television and newspaper media in Great Britain, Australia, a
nd elsewhere. Corporate media have done their best to hide corporate scandals and to downplay or distort any protests against corporations.
\par }{\b0 5.Corporate efforts to undermine pure food laws, to raise livestock under factory conditions with dangerous use of a
ntibiotics and hormones, to treat food with hazardous radiation, to modify crops genetically without adequate testing, to patent life forms and traditional remedies, and to promote \ldblquote killer\rdblquote 
 seeds that make farmers forever dependent on corporate suppliers, must be brought under control. This should be done by national laws to the extent possible and by new international controls under the UN or similar body.
\par 6. Agencies of the United Nations need to be prevented from operating in secrecy in behalf of multina
tional corporations. On the world scene, global corporations (including global bankers and financial companies) dominate international agencies unrestrained by democratic safeguards. At the }{\b0\cgrid0 
World Bank, IMF, and WTO the walls of secrecy should be removed, i
ndependent outside experts should be used, and the policy-makers and advisory groups should include balanced representation of the interests involved, not dominated by the global corporations. The World Bank should include experts not beholden to the fina
n
cial community; e.g., economists from labor organizations, consumer groups, and the academic world, as well as environmental organizations and experts from the countries involved in their development programs, and the same should apply to the IMF. The WTO
 
should include balanced representation of consumers as well as producers, and judges on its tribunals should be independent scientific experts who can distinguish legitimate environmental concerns from mere pretexts, especially in the matter of food safet
y.
\par }{\b0 
\par \page 
7. Voting in the World Bank and IMF needs to be more democratic, instead of being based on financial investment that favors rich nations, especially the United States. Reform of the IMF must include keeping it out of politics. The enormous leverage of 
the IMF over democratic institutions in borrowing countries was made plain in South Korea\rquote s presidential elections, as the Fund insisted that all presidential candidates endorse the IMF bailout agreement. 
\par 8. Every available influence should be brought to 
bear by the UN, World Bank, IMF, etc., to prevent multinational corporations (in league with repressive governments) from driving local inhabitants off their land by pollution from poisons such as cyanide used in mining, by oil spills into water supplies,
 
and by using violence against those who protest. There have been many instances, including Shell in Nigeria, BHP (Australia's largest company) in Papua New Guinea, Gemala Industries of Indonesia in occupied East Timor, DuPont in Goa, mining companies in t
he Philippines, and many others.}{\b0\ul  }{\b0 
\par 9. Regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and global agreements such as GATT should not be ratified without enforceable protections of the environment and workers rights. Prime examples of this need are the corporations th
at set up polluting factories in Mexico near the US border and get away with firing any employee who joins a union. Often police and armed forces of the host nation are used to coerce employees.
\par 10. Steps should be taken by national and international autho
rities to stop the bidding war in which corporations extract subsidies, tax abatements, and exemption from environmental and human rights requirements in a competition among localities for the placement of corporate activities.
\par 
\par \page 11. The \ldblquote revolving door\rdblquote  for individuals who shuttle back and forth between government positions and corporate lobbying needs to be abolished. In the US }{\b0\cgrid0 
former government administrators and congressmen become lobbyists and many make as much as a million dollars annually. Some, like Henry Kissinger, form consulting firms that lobby without disclosing the names of corporations for whom they work.}{\b0 

\par 12.Corporations should be prohibited from financing front organizations such as\ldblquote think tanks\rdblquote  and purported grassroots organizations to advocate corporate interests, or at least their role should be publicly revealed.
\par 13. Corporations should not be allowed to sponsor US presidential debates as A}{\b0\cgrid0 nheuser-Busch, U.S. Airways and 3Com}{\b0  did in 2000. After the original organizer, }{\b0\cgrid0 the League of Women V
oters opened the debates to a third party candidate in 1980, the two major parties set up a Commission on Presidential Debates (run out of a political consulting firm's office in Washington, D.C.) that has set rules effectively excluding third party candi
dates.
\par 14. People should be provided information on how to organize to deal with local issues--how to deal with Wal-Mart moving into a small town, or a corporate polluter nearby, cleaning up a polluted neighborhood, or how to oppose large developments that 
destroy a community's lifestyle.}{\b0  (Al Norman of \ldblquote Sprawl-Busters\rdblquote  who has helped 88 smaller firms fight Wal-Mart, is one source.) 
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 15. People who wish to do so should be encouraged to develop and put into practice local economies, beginning with local food e
conomies, to shorten the distance between producers and consumers, to make the connections between the two more direct, and to make this local economic activity a benefit to the local community.
\par }{\b0 \page OTHER PROPOSALS SUPPORTED BY MANY OR MOST FORUM MEMBERS:
\par 
\par 16.There should be a democratically chosen body on a global level to act as an umpire to enforce rules of the economic game.
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 17. Restore the }{\b0 "mixed system" in which private businesses, producer cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and government agencies all
 played their part. This has largely been destroyed in the US and other countries where it used to flourish. Preserve it wherever it survives.}{\b0\cgrid0 
\par }{\b0 18. Corporations should be prohibited from donating to political parties or campaigns.
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 19.Political campaigns should be publicly financed to replace bribery by means of campaign finance.
\par 20.Lobbying should be strictly limited by forbidding anything of value being offered to public officials.
\par 21. Make corporate officers personally responsible for violating laws.
\par 22. Make corporations report to the public, as well as shareholders, on their undertakings and plans that affect workers, consumers, and the environment.
\par }{\b0 23.In regard to the terms and length of copyrights on \ldblquote intellectual property\rdblquote  the right balance needs to be
 achieved to provide inducement for creative work without locking it out of the public domain for an unreasonably long period. The same applies to patented inventions. In the US entertainment companies like Disney were successful in lobbying to extend the
 duration of copyright far beyond the lifetimes of the creators.
\par \page 24. There should be a body such as the \ldblquote Environmental Council\rdblquote  proposed by Earth Action to make binding decisions to protect the planet, perhaps by}{\b0\cgrid0  transforming an already existing UN institu
tion, with its actions subject to approval by the General Assembly, combined with an expanded environmental role for the World Court.}{\b0 
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 25. All nations need to agree to implement simultaneously a range of measures to re-regulate global markets and corporatio
ns in order to restore genuine democracy, environmental protection, and peace around the world. This is because no nation nor group of nations alone can control global capital nor implement vital economic, social or environmental policies that might incur
 market or corporate displeasure. A method for breaking this impasse is proposed by the International Simultaneous Policy Organization (ISPO), whose website is www.simpol.org.
\par }{\b0 26. If there is no other way to overcome the favored status US courts have given 
to corporations, it would have to be accomplished by constitutional amendment, making the limitations and responsibilities of corporations so clear the courts could not interpret them away.
\par 27. Corporations should be required to have national charters rather than seeking charters in more permissive internal or external jurisdictions.
\par 28. Foreign corporations should be subject to the same taxes and laws as domestic corporations.
\par 29. Since the historical basis of all corporate charters is service beneficial t
o the general public, any corporate activity not beneficial to the public, especially if it involves explicitly illegal actions, should be cause for charter revocation both in the case of the parent corporation and of its foreign subsidiaries.
\par  
\par \page 30. National laws protecting the environment, public health, safety, and human rights within any country should also apply to its corporations and their subsidiaries when operating outside that country.
\par 31. Public officials should be prevented from holding secret meetings with heads of corporations and financial institutions, as at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg, and the Trilateral Commission.}{\b0\cgrid0 
\par }{\b0 32. Businesses should be encouraged to use energy and resources efficiently without paying subsidies.}{\b0\cgrid0  In the efficient energy use chapter of Jim Bell\rquote 
s book he cites numerous large corporation who have invested in energy and resource use efficiency measures \ldblquote and in every case their return on investment was better than their investments in their product lines.\rdblquote 
\par 33. As proposed by Jim Bell, governments should use experts from economics and accounting to determine the true cost of various goods, and then pass laws to include externalities, such as environmental damage, normally neglected in retail prices.}{
\b0\expnd0\expndtw-3  Possible questions: Does this method}{\b0\cgrid0 
 create a huge bureaucracy of accountants to figure the true costs and lawyers to dispute them? Who gets the price increase? Does it become excess profit for the corporations? Does the government tax it away and use the proceeds
 to offset pollution and hazardous waste? If so, how do we prevent it being frittered away in litigation as is being done regarding the SuperFund taxes that were supposed to clean up toxic waste? What about the effect of these higher prices on GDP? Nation
al production is conventionally measured by market prices, so wouldn\rquote t the damage to environment and humans now be counted as an increase in GDP?}{\b0\expnd0\expndtw-3 
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 
\par }{\b0 \page 34. T}{\b0\expnd0\expndtw-3 he obverse of true cost pricing is \ldblquote The Neuman Proposal,\rdblquote  which would have the government pay individual
s to reduce their travel by car or plane in order to decrease emission of greenhouse gasses that contribute to global climate change. This raises questions of the possibility of enactment, the accuracy and administrative cost of determining these subsidie
s, and the possibility of fraud or misuse.
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 35. Limit the size that corporations can attain or their ability to merge to reduce competition. }{\b0 Of the world's 100 largest economic entities, 51 are now corporations and 49 are countries according to the Institute
 for Policy Studies. The world's top 200 corporations account for over a quarter of economic activity on the globe while employing less than one percent of its workforce. http://www.ips-dc.org/top200.htm 
\par 36. Remove the "limited liability" of corporations 
(Inc., LLC, Ltd., SA, NV, GmbH), making the liability of corporations real and full, so it will have an impact on the shareholders and will guide them to more responsible actions. Limited liability without responsibility has caused much of the trouble we 
see today.
\par }{\b0\cgrid0 37. Some people propose that capitalism be abolished. Richard Moore opined, \ldblquote that if we put the necessary democratic and environmental constraints on market economics, then we will have abolished capitalism.\rdblquote 
 Others would go further to replace markets and private investment entirely.}{\b0 
\par 38. }{\b0\cgrid0 Localized economic control should replace multinational corporate control. If there is local economic control, then democracy may continue as a healthy form of government. Locally elected leaders may come together
 as the democratic representatives in a confederation.
\par 
\par }{\b0 \page 39. There should be }{\b0\cgrid0 a large international peace-keeping force under the control of the U.N. or some other agency that ensures equitable distribution of natural resources and peace, after all weapons 
of mass destruction have been destroyed.
\par 40. Large numbers of people should reduce using energy sufficiently to let the power brokers know who really is in control. 
\par }{\b0 41. People could stop eating beef. Just in Central America alone 35 million people are now
 either landless or own too little land to support themselves while the transnational corporations have continued to drive the locals away and clear forest to raise beef cattle (1992 figures).

\par This chapter asserts that control of the world's finances by major banks and corporations, in league with the International Monetary Fund, must be broken. The IMF acts to protect
 banks and speculators from losses due to bad judgment, while pressuring borrowing governments to take actions that favor penetration by multinational corporations and curtailment of government protections for its citizens. Also considered are concentrati
on of financial power, mismeasurement of GDP, and the merits of local currencies.
\par There is an old saying that \ldblquote money makes the world go round.\rdblquote  It reflects the extent to which control of money determines so much else that happens on this planet. Presidents of the United States like to be described as \ldblquote 
the leader of the free world.\rdblquote  Other holders of public office throughout the world likewise consider themselves \ldblquote in control.\rdblquote  In reality they often are merely responding to the pressures and carrying out the wi

\par Wealth is known to be quite concentrated, although recent global figures are hard to find, especially for wealth rather than income. According to a recent study by World Bank economist Branko Milanovic, about 50 millio
n people who made up the top one percent in the world\rquote s five billion population had 9.5% of the world\rquote s income in 1993. That was more than the whole bottom half who had only 8.5% (published January 18, 2002, in the }{\b0\i Economic Journal}{

\par }{\b0 Such banking families as Rothschi
ld, Morgan, and Rockefeller have long exerted a powerful influence on public policy, including the financing of wars. In modern times, control is largely exercised by major financial houses and huge corporations whose interests are promoted by the Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, agencies for export financing, and regional development organizations.
\par There is much confusion about the functions of the IMF and the World Bank. Both were created at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 during Wo
rld War II. The original and official name of the World Bank is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is a better description of its purpose. Instead of being a bank in the usual sense, it was intended to provide financial aid b
y making and insuring loans where needed to promote economic recovery throughout the world. Ostensibly,  it is still pursuing that  objective,  but its methods have 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page been criticized as counterproductive and its management has acknowledged that reform is needed.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 The IMF\rquote 
s original function, on the other hand, was to maintain fixed and stable exchange rates among the currencies of member nations. This was largely based on a standing offer of the United States to other governments that it would buy or sell gol
d at a fixed price of $35 per ounce from its huge hoard at Fort Knox. When that policy was dropped and national currencies were allowed to \ldblquote float\rdblquote 
 in the l970s, the IMF found a new mission. It began to offer loans to developing countries with strings attached, and later added guarantees of loans by international private banks with similar conditions attached.
\par When a currency crisis occurs now, as it did in Asia late in 1997 and in Argentina in 2002, for example, the IMF remedy is to demand austerity and der
egulation in exchange for additional loans or loan extensions. Its policies are thus in step with those of the World Bank for \ldblquote structural adjustment\rdblquote 
 that have caused such opportunities for big business and disasters for local populations as described in Chapter 3.
\par In the Asian crisis, for example, the global financial powers hastily put together a rescue package, bailing out the unwise investments of banks and others. South Korea, one of the major recipients of funding, did not punish corrupt politicians i
nvolved in the crisis, but agreed to give foreign corporations more access to its domestic market, open its bond market, and speed up the opening of branch offices by foreign banks and stock companies. In addition the IMF arrogantly insisted that all cand
idates in South Korea\rquote s presidential elections endorse the IMF bailout agreement. 
\par Another method of dealing with currency crises has been propping up of national currencies by foreign exchange operations of governments or their central banks at the expense
 of the public. Experience   has   shown   that   such  efforts  have only  temporary 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page effects at great cost. An example was the vain and costly effort in 1992 by central banks in England and Germany to support a weak British pound. This was the time Geor
ge Soros' hedge fund won an estimate $1 billion profit betting the banks would not succeed. The British pound fell 41% in eleven months, as measured against the Japanese yen, and Britain had to withdraw from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) for stabilizi
ng European currencies. On another occasion, more than $50 billion of US taxpayers' money was used to bolster the Mexican peso at the end of 1994, mainly benefiting Wall Street financial interests.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 One answer to the crises caused by such speculation in curr
encies could be the tax proposed by the late Nobel-Prize-winning Yale economist James Tobin that would discourage currency speculation by making it less profitable. His proposal is promoted by Attac, a 27,000-member organization in France, the Association
 
for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens. The Tobin tax at one-quarter percent would raise about $250 billion a year, exceeding five times all current international aid, but could not be levied by any single country without causi
ng financial companies to move to more permissive venues.
\par Another proposal to stabilize exchange rates would be to base currencies on actual commodities rather than existing credit money that is subject to risk by the herd mentality that drives speculators. 
\par  Money has come almost exclusively under the control of privately owned banks. The history of money runs from barter without money, to commodities used to define the value of other goods, and to rare items such as gold and silver generally accepted as pa
yment for other goods and services. Then governments started making coins of gold and silver as a convenient means of insuring purity and accurate weight.
\par \page The next development was for goldsmiths in the Middle Ages to accept gold for safekeeping, issuing p
aper documents as receipts, which were found to be more convenient to carry than the actual metal. This led to the discovery by goldsmiths that these receipts, which were in effect paper money, remained in circulation for considerable times before being u
sed to claim the precious metal, and so they issued receipts for more gold than they actually had.
\par These receipts were issued to borrowers who were expected to repay the amount with interest. Loaning at interest being forbidden by the Christian church at that time, this banking operation became an attractive trade for Jews.
\par Meanwhile, governments began to issue paper money that promised redemption in precious metals, usually gold. They also, in time, discovered they could get away with issuing more paper tha
n they had gold reserves to back up. Most, perhaps all, currency throughout the world is now redeemable only for more paper, and its purchasing power depends wholly on public confidence.
\par Banks also discovered that they could create money in another form by simply crediting a customer\rquote s account with a balance equal to the amount of a loan document signed by the customer. Just as goldsmith\rquote 
s receipts were not all claimed at once, the balances in customers\rquote  bank accounts are not all claimed at once. Thus the banks are able to issue such credits amounting to many times the bank\rquote s capital, the ratio being set by bank regulators.

\par With the purchasing power of currency depending entirely on public confidence (and the herd mentality of Wall Street), it is apparent th
at the structure is extremely fragile. If the public fears run-away inflation, a run on banks is likely. To build confidence and to ensure that banks\rquote 
 profits from interest are not eroded over time, central banks take deflationary measures whenever there is a

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 As another way of maintaining public confidence, central banks also call on the government to bail out (with public funds) financial firms deemed "too big to 
fail." This allows bankers to take bigger risks, with profits going to the bankers while debts and bank failures are at the expense of the public. 
\par The important interest rate decisions are made outside the structures of government that are answerable to the public. In the United States, whose dollars have become the }{\b0\i de facto}{\b0 
 medium for international exchange, the Federal Reserve Board sits atop a banking hierarchy. Its members are insulated from government by long overlapping term appointments and control 
the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that actually issue the U.S. currency and whose shares are owned by other banks. FRB Chairman Alan Greenspan, first appointed by President Reagan, has become possibly the most powerful influence on the world economy.

\par T
he results of monetary policy exercised by the central banks to counter business cycles are usually judged by the rate of inflation, imperfectly measured, and by economic growth, measured very imperfectly by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As noted in Chapt
er 1, that measure is seriously flawed. 
\par For example, when a mother pays for child care, transportation, and outside meals, so she can work for wages, both her wages and expenses are counted in GDP, but her previous work in the home was not counted. Also, e
nvironmentally destructive activities are counted in GDP, as are the costs of repairing or counteracting the destruction.

 from liberal economic theory, which was opposed to charging interest and led to the concept that idle money should depreciate. At that time of crisis, according to the history given on the WIR web site (}{\field\flddirty{\*\fldinst {\b0

\par Entrepreneurs seeking to start or expand a business can get financing from banks or issuance of corporate bonds only with the promise of paying interest. The alte

\par 
\par \page THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS WERE SUBMITTED TO THE FORUM MEMBERS AS A SUMMARY OF THOSE ON WHICH ALL WERE THOUGHT TO AGREE:
\par }{ }{\b0 1. Control of the world's finances by major banks and corp
orations, in league with the International Monetary Fund, must be broken. The IMF acts to protect banks and speculators from losses due to bad judgment, while pressuring borrowing governments to take actions that favor penetration by multinational corpora
tions and curtailment of government protections for its citizens. 
\par  2. Any international organizations such as IMF, the World Bank, and various regional development agencies that make grants or loans to assist nations in financial crises should not be under
 the exclusive control of bankers; they should be responsible and accountable to elected representatives of the world's people. The agents of major banks and corporations tend to do what is in their own interest rather than that of the affected population
s.
\par  3. No such organizations should be allowed to operate in secret, and they should be required to consult with non-governmental organizations; otherwise, conditions imposed on recipients may have onerous consequences that are unknown to the public until t
oo late.
\par  4. These international organizations must not require any nation, as a condition of aid, to curtail any services or protections it affords its people, or to sell off any government operations to private companies. There have been past instances w
hen well-run government operations were forcibly privatized with resulting price increases, loss of employment and/or damage to the environment. 
\par  
\par \page 5. Nor should these agencies require recipients to charge fees for children to attend school and for people
 to access basic health services. User fees for education discourage school attendance and user fees for health services lead to preventable death and disease. 
\par  6. These international organizations must also not require actions that favor penetration by m
ultinational corporations in preference to local economic activity. Such actions have often deprived inhabitants of their traditional use of land and forced them to seek a living in the cities after they were driven off their land by armed forces or by po
isoning of their streams with industrial waste, such as cyanide used in gold mining.
\par  7. The "neo-liberal" economic approach that permeates these agencies must be overcome; the attitude of their bankers and multinational corporate allies places greater impo
rtance on rights of banks and corporations than on the liberties and economic welfare of the population. 
\par  8. Competition must be restored to the financial world by breaking the grip of monopolistic chains of banks, stockbrokers, and insurance companies th
at have crowded out independent entities and formed dangerous financial corporations across national and functional boundaries. In recent years these chains have grown, not mainly by providing better service to customers, but through mergers and acquisiti
o
ns contrary to the intent of antitrust laws in various nations. The US Congress, after receiving many favors and contributions from financial firms, repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and allowed banks again to sell financial securities and insurance
.
\par  9. Local mediums of exchange should be encouraged to reduce dependence on national currencies, international bankers, and manipulated exchange rates.   Scrip not issued by governments 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page or banks has been successfully introduced in some localities, including LETS (Local Employment/Exchange Trading System).
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 
 10. Likewise, mutual credit and barter in situations where appropriate should weaken the grip of the dominant financial institutions. New information technologies are making these arrangements more feasible. 
\par  11. Production should be measured without the errors of present Gro
ss Domestic Product (GDP) calculations, which, among other things, ignore value produced outside the money economy, such as work in the home, and count the destruction of natural resources as production.
\par  12. Governments and non-governmental organizations 
should encourage employee ownership of businesses, thus guarding against shortsighted policies of absentee ownership. Banks must not be allowed to dictate the selection of management, as is often the case at present.
\par 
\par  OTHER PROPOSALS SUPPORTED BY MANY OR MOST FORUM MEMBERS:
\par 
\par 13. Nations that owe crushing debt because of past international banking policies need relief from that debt. International efforts should be made to recover funds diverted from those countries by leaders who embezzled them, and new gr
ants or loans should be offered only when conditions are met to safeguard them from misuse. A bank that lends, without precautions, to a military dictator who then absconds with the money leaving his citizenry holding the debt is a predatory lender. Inter
national predatory lending laws could absolve poor citizens from repayment of such debt. 
\par \page interest in monetary decisions, must not be in control of central banks; and they must not be allowed to cause widespread unemployment by raising interest rates on the pretext of inflation risk.
\par 15. Banks and money systems are the public's economic infrastructure like roads, rivers, and airspace. Bankers should be trustees with a fiduciary duty to be devoid of self-interest and to operate banks for the sole benefit of 
the communities and nations in which they operate. Banks should never be run for private profit, and no country should permit foreign nationals to own their banks. As a fiduciary operation, no bank should be allowed to engage in speculation in currency or
 other instruments.
\par 16. National currencies must not be propped up by foreign exchange operations of governments or their central banks at the expense of the public. Experience has shown that such efforts have only temporary effects at great cost. 
\par 17. Inst
ead of financing government services by taxes that are mostly imposed on productive activity, funds should be obtained by taxes and/or fees on externalized costs (pollution, health hazards, environmental damage, etc.) and financial transactions (via the T
o
bin tax). To prevent corporations from escaping taxation these charges should be imposed at the global level, partly financing worldwide needs and partly apportioned to member states. The benefits would be relief of existing taxes on useful work, discoura
gement of operations harmful to humans and the environment, and limitation of speculation in currencies and financial instruments that amounts to gambling and disrupts normal commerce. 
\par 18. The development of currencies\emdash local, national, or worldwide\emdash based on actual commodities rather than existing fiat money should be encouraged, along with mutual credit systems. 
\par \page 19. Support and encourage the restoration of a \ldblquote mixed system\rdblquote  in which private businesses, producer cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and government agencies all played their part prior to the ascendancy, of the \ldblquote 
Chicago School\rdblquote  disciples of Milton Friedman.

Concentrated ownership and control is dangerous enough in other areas, but it is especially harmful with regard to communications media. That is because it allows a few powerful people to limit and distort what information other people receive.
\par In 1999, when there were still some restrictions media moguls were trying to break down, Rupert Murdoch and his Australian company, News Corporation, controlled over 70% of the press in Australia, and over 35% in Britain. They also had the New York }{

\par Time-Warner and Bertelsmann AG were then making major acquisitions, and the three traditional US television networks (before Murdoch\rquote s Fox) were in the hands of General Electric, Westinghouse, and the Disney Corporation.
\par By 2002 the monopo
listic tendency had gone much further and information was increasingly dominated by entertainment. Viacom, owner of Paramount motion picture studios, book publishers, MTV and other cable channels, replaced Westinghouse as owner of the CBS television netwo
rk. A special issue of }{\b0\i The Nation}{\b0  (January 7-14, 2002) contained a color chart summarizing the holdings of the \ldblquote Big Ten\rdblquote  corporations that make up the media cartel.
\par These media-controlling corporations were shown to have revenues ranging from AT&T\rquote s $555 billion and General Electric\rquote s  $130  billion  down  to  Bertelsmann\rquote s  $17  billion  and 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page News Corporation\rquote s $12 billion. The chart showed many joint ventures and percentage shares of ownership involving various of the ten companies.

st in the United States, polls have shown that most people rely on television for their news, that medium has special importance. The Big Ten generally include both the studios that produce content with the channels that disseminate it. Al Franken, one of
 several people \ldblquote The Nation\rdblquote  asked to comment on the chart, explained how this happened.
\par \ldblquote In 1995 the networks prevailed after years of fierce lobbying before Congress\rdblquote  in having the financial interest and syndication rules (fin-syn) rescinded that had prev
ented networks from owning more than a certain percentage of the shows they aired. Now, he wrote, \ldblquote The same people who are scheduling the shows are making the shows, so what you see reflects the tastes of fewer and fewer people.\rdblquote   

\par The principle that conte
nt and distribution should be kept independent of each other is also breached with regard to DVDs (digital video discs). CSS (Content Scrambling System) prevents copying of DVDs and any software used for playing back DVDs must pay the major studios for a 
l
icense. The world is split into six regions with DVD discs and players that are incompatible with those in other regions. Similarly, the incompatibility of television systems (and camcorders) in different parts of the world serves commercial interests at 
the expense of public convenience.

niversal, world's second largest film library, and 3 cinema theater companies), and Liberty Media Corp. (spun off from AT&T, has shares in six movie companies). 
\par Music distribution is also important to AOL/Time-Warner, Bertelsmann, SONY, Vivendi Universal, and Liberty Media. Many of the companies have theme parks and professional sports teams. Further interests range from General Electric\rquote 
s nuclear reactors and financial services, through Disney\rquote s cartoon merchandise, to Vivendi Universal\rquote s hundreds of recycling, landfill, and incinerator sites worldwide, plus 220 advertising agencies in 66 countries.
\par Internet involvement of the Big Ten includes Bertelmann\rquote s search engines, Internet service in Europe by Bertelmann and Vivendi Universal, AOL/Time-Warner\rquote s AOL and Compuserve Internet service, SONY\rquote 
s Internet service in Japan, and many websites related to their television channels.
\par Access to the Internet is overwhelmingly through computers running Microsoft\rquote s Windows operating system and its Explorer net browser.
 This virtual monopoly was achieved by methods ruled by US courts to be illegal restraint of trade under the antitrust laws. Unlike the open-source Linux system, Windows keeps its source code secret and Microsoft uses its market strength to get its way wi

\par Media problems have been discussed on the Blue Ear Forum, which consists mostly of journalists and writers around the world. A guest participant was Robert McChesney of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, author of \ldblquote

\par In another book with co-author John Nichols, \ldblquote It's the Media Stupid\rdblquote  (Seven Stories Press, 2000) they declared: \ldblquote No, the media system is not the sole cause of our political crisis, nor even t
he primary cause, but it reinforces every factor contributing to the crisis, and it fosters a climate in which the implementation of innovative democratic solutions is rendered all but impossible.\rdblquote  }{\b0\cf6 
\par }{\b0 When \ldblquote The Nation\rdblquote  published its special issue with the ch
art showing the holdings of the Big Ten, discussion on Blue Ear heated up and Jay Rosen of Columbia University chided members for not differentiating between ownership and control, and for implying that control was so complete it was hopeless to oppose it
. He asserted that freedom of expression of those in the forum belied their claims of media control. 
\par \page After various members of that forum responded to Rosen questioning whether he had any concern about recent developments affecting the media, however, he admitted concern and declared: 
\par \ldblquote I'm worried about the rise of market values to a position where they trump all other values, such as public service, professionalism, truth, accuracy, genuine art, genuine popular culture, honesty, ethics. I think that disma
ntling the regulatory powers of the Federal government over broadcasting was a cave-in to major media corporations, and fully in line with the Republican party's agenda during those years, which was to evacuate any notion of the public interest beyond the
 \lquote verdict of the marketplace.\rquote "
\par The tight control of the communications media by major corporations leaves a few cracks and crevices, as Rosen pointed out, where information can seep through, such as Internet forums, small circulation publications, letters 
to the editor, local access cable channels, and occasional documentaries on public television or even some commercial TV reports.
\par Overall, though, the information most people receive avoids issues about which the corporations owning the media (or their advertisers) are uncomfortable. Several examples will illustrate this point.
\par Very little has been revealed about dioxin as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has kept the scientific results of dioxin reassessment bottled up under both Clinton and 
Bush. Miniscule amounts are extremely harmful to humans. One source of dioxin is the bleaching with chlorine of newsprint\emdash 
not something the major newspapers want to talk about. Dioxin is a component of Agent Orange, whose connection with illnesses of Vietnam veterans was long covered up by government and media.
\par \page Another public health hazard that has been kept under wraps is the presence of bovine growth hormones (BGH) in milk and other dairy products in the U.S. They are causative for breast, prostate, and 
colon cancer, and diabetes according to studies in such peer-reviewed journals as \ldblquote Lancet\rdblquote  and \ldblquote Science.\rdblquote 
 They are in school lunch programs in the United States but banned in Canada and the European Union. Political connections of Monsanto, the only maker 
of these hormones, may explain why the EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not acted. When two television reporters at a Fox station in Florida tried to report the dangers of BGH, they were fired.
\par One more of many possible examples is that 
much of the nuclear radiation continually leaching into water tables and communities is from polluted sites never cleaned up by General Electric. Since that company owns NBC, no disclosure can be expected there. Some of the major media have been unable to
 avoid mentioning the dioxin in the Hudson River that GE refuses to clean up.
\par In the political arena, U.S. television networks allowed a commission of the Republican and Democratic parties to exclude candidates of other parties from the presidential debates
 in 2000. In fact, the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, was forcibly excluded from the room.

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Phillips also noted that both the BBC an

nt in power. He cited report from France regarding how the Bush administration, shortly after assuming office, slowed down FBI investigations of al-Qaeda and terrorist networks in Afghanistan in order to deal with the Taliban on oil. These, and other susp

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Members of the FixGov forum seem to have arrived at the following consensus on necessary reforms for the media:
\par 1. Information media (including newspapers, magazines, books, television, radio, digital communication, and cinema) must be free of government censorship of facts and opinio
ns. What are reasonable restrictions involving national security and decency will always be debatable. Governments tend to err on the side of too much restriction.
\par 2. The media must also be free of censorship by commercial cartels, which have been concentr
ating ownership of all types of media across national boundaries, putting these corporations in position to block and/or distort information to suit their commercial and political interests. As many people recognize what is happening, public trust in the 
media is undermined. 
\par 3. In the case of print media, full information and diversity of views is most likely to prevail when there is the maximum of competition. Government should not interfere with publication, but it should enforce strong antitrust laws to
 prevent economic power from driving out competition.
\par 4. The broadcast media should likewise consist of independent television and radio stations, not having interlocking ownership and control with print media, and certainly not dominated by parent compani
es that are primarily interested in entertainment products and/or conflicting commercial activities.
\par 5. Although the BBC has built a reputation for quality television and often broadcasts information displeasing to the government in power, it is dangerous, in general, for government to have a monopoly or dominance of the airwaves, as demonstrated 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page in many countries where that situation has turned broadcasting into a government propaganda machine.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 6. In the United States the Public Broadcasting System once 
provided a useful counterpoint to commercial television, but the attacks of Newt Gingrich on public television have largely converted it into an imitation of commercial TV with sponsored messages and promotional announcements. National Public Radio has re
tained more of its objectivity under this pressure.
\par 7. Government does have an important role in broadcasting, however, because frequencies have been allocated under international agreement and the spectrum available in each country is controlled by governm
ent, unlike the unlimited possibilities for print media in a free society. Broadcast rights should be auctioned periodically for the highest bid offered by a responsible party guaranteeing to provide a public service in an equitable manner.
\par 8. During elect
ion campaigns, in particular, broadcasters should be required to provide a reasonable amount of free time for political discussions with all candidates treated equally. There should also by something along the lines of the "Fairness Doctrine" formerly enf
orced by the United States Federal Communications Commission to require that if one point of view is presented on the air equal time must be given to opposing opinions.
\par 9. A limit on commercial messages (including their own promotions) should be a condition of broadcast licenses, as it was until the 1980s in the United States, and certainly 100% commercial programs known as "infomercials" should be completely prohibited.

\par 10. Newspapers and broadcasters need to be freed from the control of corporate cartels. 
Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 there has been a parade of media mergers and over 4,000 radio  stations  have  been  bought  up  in the  United  States,  while 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page television networks are now in the hands of huge corporations like General Electric, Viacom, Disney, and Rupert Murdoch\rquote 
s News Corporation. Murdoch also controls large portions of the television and newspaper media in Great Britain, Australia, and elsewhere. Corporate media have done their best to hide corporate scandals and to downplay or
 distort any protests against corporations.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 
11. Material reported as coming from "think tanks" needs to be labeled with information about the bias of such sources. They generally claim to be nonpartisan research organizations, while actually slanting their
 writings toward one party or against other and showing little evidence of any objective research despite their tax-exempt status.
\par 12. Because the mainstream media coverage of protests against WTO, IMF and World Bank abuses, such as at Seattle and Genoa an
d at the Republican and Democratic conventions, distorts the events (stressing violent actions and ignoring the message of peaceful protesters), it is important that independent media be able to continue reporting on www.indymedia.org and other Internet s
ites. The Internet itself must be kept free of control by governments and private monopolies.
\par 13. Local organizations should be allowed to operate low-power radio as another means of conveying information independent of the media cartel. So far, the lobbyin
g power of the National Association of Broadcasters with Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has blocked such efforts in the United States on spurious claims of interference with commercial radio signals.
\par 14. Writing letters to the editor of publications sometimes is a way of circulating information that is ignored in the news columns. Editors try to exhibit fairness by publishing letters expressing varied view, including ones disagreeing with the paper's 

\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page editorial policy. Such letters may have little impact, but they can start people thinking.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 15. It is important for individuals to get information "outside the box"--the television box, that is. The "infotainment" supplied by the media cartel tends to struc
ture people's thinking in a way that makes them avid consumers with short attention spans and little interest in matters of substance. It builds and reinforces stereotypes (that some scientists label "memes" or "holodynes") that prejudice a person's think
ing and reaction to new information.
\par 16. There are dangers in the recent trend to protect corporate profits with the concept of \ldblquote intellectual property\rdblquote  embodied in copyright extension long beyond the lifetime of the innovators, overreaching software patents
, and international enforcement agreements. Unreasonable copyright and patent provisions need to be reversed.

\par However, excesses of greed and technology can undermine quality of life. Because excesses of capi

\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \tab To make the world a better place is the ambition of many people. Perhaps it comes from an innate feeling that life has a purpose and from a desire to give significance to one\rquote 
s presence on this planet. Such motives need to be awakened if the necessary global reforms are to be achieved. They are strengthened when people recognize powers in the universe greater than their own private interests.
\par \page \tab Some moralists deny that there can be any good without belief in a supernatural being\emdash sometimes in the precise form that they conceive God. They claim that non-believers can 
only seek their own pleasure regardless of harm to others and that without religion there can be nothing but evil. (They tend to treat agnostics the same as atheists, although agnostics honestly admit they don\rquote 
t know while atheists flatly deny the possibility of God.)
\par \tab Facts tend to contradict that assertion, as one can easily find good and bad in both the devout and the nonbelievers. When thinking of unselfish service to others, names that quickly come to mind include Dr. Albert Schweitzer, Mother Teresa, 
and Mahatma Gandhi, all motivated by traditional religion, and many others could be cited. Yet history is full of contrary examples, ostensibly devout people claiming God approved of their mistreatment of others, as in the case of the Crusades, the Inquis
i
tion, and apologists for slavery. Current examples include both sides in Northern Ireland, Hindus and Muslims in India and Pakistan, and Jewish and Arab extremists in the Middle East. It is also clear that commercial and colonial interests have often tire
d to cloak their selfish objectives behind a fa\'e7ade of religion.  
\par \tab Among people rejecting conventional religion many have been admirable, as far back as Socrates, who was put to death in 399 BC for \ldblquote neglect of the gods whom the city worships.\rdblquote  A later exam
ple is Voltaire, a satirist and crusader against tyranny, bigotry, and cruelty. Like Thomas Jefferson and others, he was a \ldblquote deist,\rdblquote 
 one who believes in a supreme being but rejects religious orthodoxy. There is no shortage of villainous nonbelievers, either, obviously including Stalin and Mao Tse-tung.  
\par \tab People of different religions and of no religion can cooperate together for good. What is important is for them to recognize freedom of thought. Unfortunately, when religion is authoritarian (whether fundamentalist Christian, orthodox Judaism, 

\par \page strict Islam, or any other) it elevates faith over thought and uses fear of damnation to enforce its particular set of beliefs. That would suggest God provided brains but does not want them to be used. 
\par \tab With respect
 for the thoughts of other people, it is possible to draw on sources of inspiration from many cultures and from such inner resources as one may find. Although people differ in their beliefs about creation and divinity, most recognize goals and principles 
greater than personal satisfaction. Some scientific studies purport to have found a spiritual center in the brain that appears to have been affected by meditation and prayer as measured by brain wave scans.

s life support system and has brought us to the brink of collapse. At the same time soaring population places increasing demands on these fragile and interconnected systems. 
\par In addition, technological advances have made human labor forces increasingly irrelevant to the production of goods and thus delinked from the financial markets. As civilization proceeds from the industrial age int
o the age of knowledge millions of people may be left behind with no means of sustenance. 
\par As detailed in previous chapters, the powerful are proceeding down the path of globalization, disregarding the needs of people and the environment while enhancing th
e fortunes of the few (see Chapter 4). This has resulted in most of the world's wealth being concentrated while many millions of others worldwide suffer from unbearable poverty with hardships bordering on deliberate inhumane treatment.
\par Under what some refer to as the \ldblquote dominator paradigm\rdblquote 
 prevailing over thousands of years, economic needs supercede the natural order of earth needs. Modern attempts to increase food production by the sale and  use  of  chemical  fertilizers,  pesticides

Now, inadequately tested bioengineering practices (genetically modified products), saturation of live stock with antibiotics, irradiation, and use of hormones to increase milk production introduce possible new dangers.  
\par As these problems become 
more evident, millions of individuals around the world are beginning to question the stability and security of our present systems and join with like-minded others to explore the situation. As a result there is a movement toward the creation of 
\ldblquote sustainable living\rdblquote  societies based on decentralized financial systems, governance through bioregionalism, and lessening of dependence on world trade.

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\tx1800\adjustright {\b0 The cells
 of this future of governance are emerging on many fronts. There are innovative social techniques such as Local Employment Trading Systems (LETS), CoHousing, Homesteading, Intentional Communitities, local scrips, food co-ops, Employee Stock Option Plans (
E
SOPs), Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs), and many others. Also hundreds of thousands of Grass Roots Organizations (GROs) are springing up around the world, solving local problems with local skills and local resources. They are no longer waiting for 
governments or corporations to solve their local problems and develop their local potentials. 
\par In the physical world, atoms, molecules, or cells, in sufficient numbers tend to form networks and special conglomerations. Simpler entities combine into larger ones. Elisabet Sahtouris, in }{\b0\i Earth Dance: A Living System of Evolution,}{\b0 
 suggests that the human body with its cells organized into organs, and organs organized into a living being is a perfect metaphor for society. Ervin Laszlo and the Budapest Group carry the concept even further with their concept of \ldblquote 
General Evolution.\rdblquote 
\par The same pattern is being followed by civil society and the burgeoning GROs are following that pattern. Also, to support the network of GROs, Grassroots Support Organizations (GRSOs) are f
orming, most often by middle class professionals and technicians who recognize the inequities engendered by the current economic-political system. GRSOs reach out to give in-kind assistance and to legitimize the actions of the peasants and disenfranchised
 in their bids for empowerment and local self-reliance. Techniques, technologies, information, and service from the industrial countries are supplied through links created by international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). 
\par \page Julie Fisher in }{\b0\i The Road from Rio}{\b0 
 describes world wide network of GROs, GRSOs and INGOs in terms that fit perfectly into chaos and complexity theory. A living body of networked organizations has emerged to fill the niche produced by dysfunctional post-colonial governments. Interdep
endent social cells have developed organs assuming specialized functions that serve the whole social/political body that promises better life for the people in developing countries and the whole Earth. The natural laws being revealed in chaos, complexity,
 and Gaian theories, are working on the social level. 
\par As Elise Boulding pointed out in her book, }{\b0\i Building a Global Civic Culture}{\b0 , the heart of a new world governance has already formed. Through the revelations of science, an understanding of the cosmic pro
cess is slowly emerging. With this new understanding, humanity may be participating in the creation of a sustainable and lasting civilization based on citizen participation in local community organizations\emdash a Gaian global governance.
\par Modern forms of democra
cy are relatively new in human existence, and have never reached perfect form. Classical studies examine Athenian and Roman experience, in which important parts of the population were excluded from government. The prevailing system into the 18}{\b0\super 
th}{\b0  Century was absolute monarchy, based on the \ldblquote divine right of kings.\rdblquote 
 Neither churches nor governments were friendly to the idea that common people could rule themselves, nor even participate in government. The ideas of voting, representation, legislating, human righ
ts, politics, constitutions, or social contracts were little more than hazy academic notions. 
\par A landmark step was the curtailment of royal power in the Magna Carta imposed on King John of England in 1215 by the barons, which led,  after much travail,  to the modern constitutional 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\tx1800\adjustright {\b0 \page 
monarchy in Britain, where traditions are preserved but power is effectively in the elected parliament. Over the years constitutional monarchies in which royal powers are limited have been established in other European countries. 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\tx1800\adjustright {\b0 By the 18}{\b0\super th}{\b0  Century, masses of people recognized that they were missing out on many of the benefits that their toil had created. \ldblquote 
It was the best of times, and the worst of times,\rdblquote  as later described in Charles Dickens\rquote  }{\b0\i The Tale of Two Cities. }{\b0 The Ameri
can Revolution in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789 (interrupted by the emperor Napoleon and a restoration of Bourbon kings until another revolt in 1848) ushered in new concepts of democracy. 
\par Modern democracy came into being within what has been call
ed the "Dominator Paradigm" based on the Genesis creation story holding that the earth was created for the use and domination of man. This was further developed by Greek philosophers. Then the Medieval Church and its "chain of being" put man near the top 
of a hierarchy, followed by women, children, other races, animals, plants, and the earth. In 1776 Adam Smith's laissez-faire economic theories held that the best for all would be produced by the self-interest of each through the operation of an 
\ldblquote invisible hand.\rdblquote  
\par The American colonies had assumed a degree of self-government under the British Crown, but voting rights were usually denied women, blacks, Catholics, Jews, slaves, and anyone lacking substantial land holdings. Probably no more than 1/3 of the adult
 free men could vote. Office holding was even more restricted, based on property ownership. Many of these limitations continued after the revolution. In spite of subsequent extended suffrage to blacks, women, and all citizens, the voice of the people has 
been steadily eroded as corporations have grown in size and power. (See Chapter 2.)
\par \page It is now possible to enter a new phase of democracy due to expanding civil society, modern technology, and a new scientific understanding of how evolution works. The theories of Chaos, Complexity and Gaia have a suggested a "Gaian Paradigm
\rdblquote  in which the earth and all the cosmos evolve as a single unit, system, or \ldblquote holon.\rdblquote 
 Every entity of the universe is a unit composed of smaller units and embedded in larger units. The whole is dependent on every part, and each part is dependent on the whole, evolving in h
armony and unison. Simple units combine to form more complex ones, which in turn combine in ever more complex forms.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Biological evolution is the most obvious example of the tendency toward the ordering of simple entities into more complex systems. Flexibil
ity is one of the cardinal biological principles of evolution. Without flexibility a life form is not sustainable, it cannot change to meet new conditions. But governments, like corporations, have been organized within the Dominator Paradigm\emdash 
good management means rigid order controlled from the top. 
\par That idea is contradicted by a best-selling book \ldblquote Birth of the Chaordic Age\rdblquote  by Dee W. Hock, retired head of the Visa worldwide credit card company composed of more than 20,000 banks. He has been acclaimed for 
his successful management style that emphasizes choosing capable subordinates and letting them solve problems with their unique abilities instead of micro-managing them. He believes that successful systems thrive on the edge of chaos with just enough orde
r to give them pattern, and calls this concept \ldblquote chaordic\rdblquote  from a combination of chaos and order.
\par If society is to meet the challenges that face it, it needs to live closer to the edge of chaos. It must welcome a degree of disorder.   Democracy since its modern inception has suffered from 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page 
its self-guilt of being inefficient. The Gaian Paradigm sees democracy in a very different light. The seeming weaknesses of democracy are its strength. The theories of Gaia, Chaos, and Complexity suggest that self-organizi
ng on the edge of chaos is natural law. It requires the messy flexibility inherent in democracy. 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 The rise of civil society, the burgeoning of GROs, the growth of social innovation, community involvement in meeting their own needs, are all parts of the pro
gressive agenda provided by nature. We may not see clearly today the final organization which will emerge if we continue to build the decentralized autonomous communities linked together in worldwide mutual aid. But, that is the way of cosmic evolution as
 it is seen from the new worldview. It portends the emergence of a new phase of democracy\emdash one in which people in community at the grassroots have a direct input to all decisions which affect their lives\emdash a new form of global governance.

This chapter considers the limitations of traditional education and proposes lifetime learning that enables people to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Such learning is less structured than traditional systems and reflects scientific discoveries about
 the non-linear functioning of the human brain. It turns away from the \ldblquote dominator paradigm\rdblquote  that claims nature exists for exploitation by man in favor of the \ldblquote gaian paradigm\rdblquote 
 that emphasizes interaction of living things. From neighborhood day care centers t

\par For democracy to work best the public should be literate and well educated in orde
r to recognize the truth or falsity of political arguments. That is not an argument for voter qualifications because the individual, regardless of high or low intellectual development, is a better judge than anyone else of what is good for his or her welf
are. However, it is an argument for providing universal education.
\par The political corruption and media concentration already discussed, as well as subsidized propaganda machines disguised as research organizations or \ldblquote think tanks,\rdblquote  make it all the more impor

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 The growth of free public schools in the United States in the 19}{\b0\super th}{\b0 
 century has been credited for much of the progress experienced by that country. The Industrial Age, spreading from a few factories in the Northeast, req
uired that farmers and tradesmen learn new skills and new lifestyles. Their lives were controlled by the assembly line and the factory whistle instead of the weather and planting seasons. They were attracted by wages and urban conveniences not found in ru
ral areas. 
\par To produce new generations of workers with industrial skills and a sense of discipline the new education system was created and, not wholly incidentally, gave the young a background of information that helped them become useful citizens of a dem
ocracy. This system served as a model for universal education in other advanced countries. The provision of government-financed higher education for veterans of World War II was a further documented success. 
\par Since then, there has been much more criticism of U.S. education.}{\b0\i  The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators}{\b0

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Perhaps it is time for another revolution in education, as we face a new age of transition. Factories no longer dominate employment in the U.S.
 and many other developed nations. For example, only 3% or 4% of Americans now work on assembly lines. Traditional emphasis on training for jobs has suppressed people's natural curiosity and the joy of learning for its mere satisfaction. The appreciation 
and love for life for all individuals is dependent on their grasp of knowledge of the world and the world of knowledge. 
\par Neither in the economically powerful G8 nations, nor in the towns of less developed countries where multinational corporations have open
ed factories, is there the traditional pattern where father goes to work, mother keeps the home, and the children attend school. Today's world is a complex maze of ever-changing networks within networks. 
\par \page Communications have made it possible for books lik
e this one to be written collectively by people living thousands of miles apart and never meeting one another face to face. Each person is a node of a network, simultaneously enmeshed in a myriad of interlinked communities and virtual communities. As soci
al relations have become more complex, they have also become more changeable. 
\par Within the old social/economic/education system one could expect to learn in school all that was needed to hold a job. Graduation was regarded as one's passport for a lifetime in
 the world of work. That is no longer true. Students in societies of advanced technology are told that they must expect to change jobs and careers several times in their lives. In other cultures, the way of life that had not changed for many generations m
ay become impossible to follow because of manmade or natural changes in the environment.
\par It is no longer enough for schools to pass on the educational content needed for a job. It becomes far more important to develop versatility and the ability to adapt to
 new challenges. The learning system of the future must find ways to help people continue their education and intellectual growth.
\par The past few decades have seen an erosion of the traditional nuclear family (if it ever was), but the need for "belonging" to
 an extended family is still a basic need for all humans. A new form of intentional community is emerging that, with nurturing, can become the soul of society. Cooperative Community Life-Long Learning Centers (CCL-LLCs)\emdash

 ones in which life patterns are set. Crucial to the citizens of the future is the capacity to change and to continue lifelong learning. The radically changing society requires citizens who can change with the times. Future citizens must be prepared from 
their earliest days, and throughout their lives, to be the creators of continually evolving webs of being. 
\par \page Some of us have a vision of "Learning Communities" that will replace government schools and will know how to change with the times. They will also p

\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 First, "Learning Communities" implies communities that are learning and continually evolving, a connotation
 most relevant because all of society is in a state of transition. The European-American world was built on what is sometimes called the }{\b0\i Dominator Paradigm}{\b0 
, based on the view that the earth, including women, children, animals, plants, and the physical universe, was made for the domination and use of man. 
\par Science has revealed a different cosmos\emdash one that evolves holonistically; that is, a world of interlocked and interdependent systems or holons within each other that make up a new worldview we call the }{\b0\i Gaian Paradigm}{\b0 
. It conceives of humans as imbedded in turn in family, community, society, and nature. The wellbeing of each individual depends on the wellbeing of the larger holons in which he is imbedded as well as the small holons that are his parts. Thus th

 a good thing? Networking also opens up the possibility for saboteurs to do catastrophic damage to public utilities and systems. And what happens when programming fails and there is no provision for human intervention?

 human life spans and new discoveries offer relief from many diseases, but rapidly increasing population raises new problems. How large a total population can be supported by the natural resources of the planet? Agricultural progress has made it possible 
to produce enough food for everyone, although flaws of distribution still result in shortages in some places while there are surpluses being destroyed elsewhere. World population has grown far beyond what Malthus in the 18}{\b0\super th}{\b0

More varieties of entertainment are available than ever before, with sounds and images reaching everywhere, reflected from satellites as well as travelling on fiber-optic cable, in a wide swath of the broadcast spectrum, and by ordinary circuits. People, 
especially the younger generations, are seldom without some form of music or talk\emdash 
nor are they lacking in propaganda and/or advertising messages. The quality of entertainment, however, has declined, catering to the lowest common denominator, and news has to
 travel the same channels, often being selected and distorted to serve entertainment and commercial purposes. Time for quiet thought and meditation has become rare in many environments. 
\par Countless international bodies exist, many within the United Nations

s people live in countries that are counted as democracies, that leaves 42% with no representative government. Even purported democracies are often far from perfect. 
\par The solution for some people is to form self-sustaining cooperative communities with respect for nature and freedom from outside control. As much merit as there may be in such life st
yles, they are not to the taste of everyone and the communities must be concerned whether governments and developers will refrain from interfering with them. The experience of many indigenous cultures as oil and mining companies moved in with collaboratio
n of corrupt governments suggests that government cannot just be ignored. 
\par Likewise, anarchy (essentially meaning to do away with all government) could only work among idealistic people who would discipline themselves, which is not the state of evolution humanity has achieved yet. Greed and \ldblquote might makes right

\par Since the forces working to seize power and wealth oppose democratic reforms, social justice, human rights, and sustainable local economies, citizens must never tire of exercising their rights. \ldblquote Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
\rdblquote  There is a constant battle to restrain politicians from accepting bribes and special interests from offering them to gain unfair advantages.
\par \page The benefits of democracy
 can only be obtained if all parties, including new ones and small start-ups, can compete for voter approval. This requires that they be able to get on the ballot and that their message can reach the public. Honest counts and fairly drawn voting districts
 are essential, and there can be advantages to preference voting, instant run-offs, proportional representation, initiatives, referendums, and the none-of\endash the-above option. 
\par Political action at the global level becomes necessary because reform efforts local
ly can be thwarted when multinational corporations threaten to move business and jobs to another more permissive jurisdiction. This calls for joint actions by nations and/or stronger world government. Democratic control must be included to prevent global 
tyranny.
\par The many territorial disputes of the world threaten peace and freedom. Self-determination should be the underlying principle, but each conflict raises unique problems that make solution difficult and slow. Respect for each other\rquote s traditions and be
liefs is difficult but essential. Arms merchants and their political allies have worsened traditional conflicts, and development programs that have concentrated people in urban slums have increased frictions. As those conditions have become intolerable, d
esperate people have taken great risks to emigrate, creating new problems for the countries where they seek asylum or economic opportunity.
\par Devolution (the return of powers to smaller political units) has been applied in Britain and discussed elsewhere. The
 advantages of bringing decisions home from national bureaucracies to manageable local areas always needs to be weighed against the advantages of uniformity of law and opportunities over a wider area.

\par }\pard\plain \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright \b\cgrid {\b0 Progress in political institutions is difficult because of the undue influence of big business and financial interests. Chief executive officers of l
arge corporations are either among the ruling elite of the world or else well compensated to be their representatives. Compensation of CEOs in the U.S., which used to be about 40 times the average for blue-collar workers in 1960, had reached a 531-to-1 ra
tio in 2001. CEOs serve on each other\rquote 
s boards of directors, along with bankers, lawyers, accountants, and financial underwriters, all voting each other salaries, fees, bonuses, perks, pensions, stock options, and other benefits paid by the stockholders.  
\par When the law requires stockholder approval of board actions, ordinary investors who own shares through mutual funds have their stock voted by fund managers without consulting them, and almost always in favor of whatever management proposes. If stockholder
s sue for misbehavior of management, the corporate officers customarily get their legal expenses paid from company funds.
\par \page The corporate scandals that began unfolding early in 2002 involving such large corporations as Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing, Tyco,
 and Rite Aid, revealed that top management, legal advisors, and auditors used accounting tricks to hide losses and inflate profits. The perpetrators walked away with millions, while ordinary employees and investors were left holding the bag as stock pric
es plummeted.
\par Among those prominent in obtaining political favors for corporations are the so-called \ldblquote defense industries.\rdblquote 
 They are big political campaign contributors, and their top officials are in and out of government positions in cabinet departments or
 the military. The governments  then  help  them sell weapons to other countries, the leading suppliers being, in order, the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, China, and Italy. 
\par The rulers of big corporations tend to get their way most of the time. On the world scene, global corporations (including global bankers and financial companies) dominate international agencies unrestrained by democratic safeguards. The }{\b0\cgrid0 
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organizatio
n (WTO) override democratic governments. The WTO has forced America and Europe to annul various health and environmental laws. Third world countries have been required to turn over public services and natural resources to private multinational corporation
s as conditions for international loans. }{\b0 
\par The buzz words for these loan conditions include \ldblquote neo-liberal,\rdblquote  \ldblquote structural adjustments,\rdblquote  and, ironically, \ldblquote reform.\rdblquote 
 In fact, these policies involve removing government protections of health, safety, workers\rquote  rights
, and the environment. Reports of the World Bank and IMF have even admitted the failure of many of their programs that were supposed to benefit less developed countries, but so far these organizations have given only lip service to human and environmental
 protection. Similarly, }{\b0\cgrid0 the North American  Free 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0\cgrid0 \page Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was supposed to protect workers rights and the environment through \ldblquote side agreements,\rdblquote  but no funds were provided. }{\b0 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Although corporations everywhere fight to escape regulation, Europe
an countries have retained more protections for workers, consumers, and the environment. In May 2002, the European Parliament in Brussels voted for new legislation holding companies and their board members responsible for their social and environmental pe
rformance in Europe and in developing countries. 
\par In recent years, however, the social-democratic parties in Europe  have  sought a  \ldblquote Third Way\rdblquote  betw
een the welfare state and the free market. Paradoxically, many people felt caught between government and corporate bureaucracies and threatened by immigration due to oppression and poverty in less prosperous countries\emdash 
giving popular support to nationalistic parties proposing to close borders against immigration.
\par Another unexpected phenomenon of economic changes has been the reduction of time people have away from work, with consequences for family and community life. When women work outside the home by choi
ce it represents growth of opportunity, but many women work for wages because of economic necessity. Many people work more than one job, none of which provide the fringe benefits that were associated with employment. Others are unemployed with reduced soc
ial assistance. In less developed countries widespread unemployment has occurred as traditional food sources have been usurped and/or polluted, driving populations to seek factory employment in the cities. 
\par The growth of monopolies and cartels has accelerated as governments increasingly abandoned enforcement of antitrust laws and courts sided with the corporations. Although mergers are claimed  to  result  in  economies of scale, the benefits are often not 

\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page realized due to bureaucracy in large businesses. In any event, business concentration destroys the competition of many suppliers that is essential to free markets \'e0

limits, and the power to combine or divide themselves as a means of escaping responsibility for actions of subsidiaries. 
\par As the corporate oligarchy has increasingly dominated economic summits and international trade meetings, these conferences attended by
 public officials gravitate toward inaccessible sites guarded by armed forces to isolate them from any public objections. Peaceful protesters have been brutally treated on the pretext of controlling vandalism, when violence was often initiated by police o

\par }{\b0\cgrid0 Corporate subsidies, endowments, junkets, propaganda and pressures have been used to bring universities, research organizations, and judicial agencies to their way of thinking. The enormous power of corporations and their friend

sorts for seminars where they are propagandized by advocates of }{\b0\i\cgrid0 laissez-faire}{\b0\cgrid0  economics.
\par By playing off one nation or locality against another, large businesses extract subsidies, privileges, tax breaks, and freedom from  regulations  concerning health,   s

The U.S. Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996, overwhelmingly supported by both major parties, effectively removed virtually all limits in the communications and entertainment industries. Congress also extended pate

\par The Internet also involves the Big Ten, as well as Microsoft, which has a virtual monopoly of 
computer operating systems and web browsers and has been held in violation of the U.S. antitrust laws. As in the case of bio-piracy, patent laws have been applied far beyond their original intent, so that not just software code but even the method of achi

According to a World Bank study, the top one percent in the world\rquote s population (about  50  million  of  the  five  billion)   had  9.5%  of the world\rquote 
s income in 1993, while the whole bottom half had only 8.5%. According to a UN study, only 1.4% of the world\rquote s income in 1992 went to the 20% who live in the world\rquote s poorest countries.
\par Wealth is known
 to be quite concentrated at present, although recent global figures are hard to find, especially for wealth rather than income.  Federal Reserve figures for 1989 showed that the richest 1% of American households accounted for nearly 40% of the nation
\rquote s wealth, and the top 20% accounted for 80% of the wealth. The rich, of course, prefer not to disclose such information, so the gap may be understated.
\par With wealth goes power. Powerful banking families have long influenced public policy and financed wars. The interests of today\rquote 
s major financial houses and corporations are promoted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (both created at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 during World War II), and by other agencies for export financing and
 regional development.
\par The original purpose of the World Bank was to provide financial aid by making and insuring loans where needed to promote economic recovery throughout the world. That of the IMF 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 \page was to maintain fixed and stable exchange rates among the currencies of member nations. When currencies were allowed to \ldblquote float\rdblquote 
 in the 1970s, the IMF took on a new mission similar to the World Bank. It offered loans (with conditions) to developing countries and guaranteed loans with similar conditions by international private banks.
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 
When a currency crisis occurs, the IMF remedy is to demand austerity and deregulation in exchange for additional loans or loan extensions. Typically, there is no demand for punishment of corrupt politicians, but there are demands t
o give foreign corporations more access to domestic markets, speed up the opening  of  branch  offices by foreign banks and stock companies, privatize government operations, reduce social welfare programs, and relax protections of workers, consumers, and 
the environment.
\par Sometimes, when speculators bet against their currency, governments or their central banks try to prop up national currencies at the expense of the public\emdash generally an expensive and futile effort. One proposal to discourage wild speculation is the 
\ldblquote Tobin tax\rdblquote 
 of the late Nobel-Prize-winning Yale economist James Tobin, promoted by Attac, a 27,000-member organization in France. By agreement among nations, financial transactions would be subject to a small tax for international aid. Another pro
posal to stabilize exchange rates would be to base currencies on actual commodities rather than existing credit money created by banks.
\par Most, perhaps all, currency throughout the world is now redeemable only for more paper, and its purchasing power depends wholly on public confidence. Banks create money by simply crediting a customer\rquote 
s account with a balance equal to the amount of a loan document signed by the customer. Since the balances in customers\rquote  bank accounts are not all claimed at once, banks are able to issue such credits amounting to many times the bank\rquote 
s capital, the ratio being set by bank regulators.
\par \page Ostensibly to protect the public against inflation, and to safeguard banks\rquote  profits, central banks take deflationary measures whenever there is a hint of inflation, often resulting in a calamitous rise in unemployment. When financial firms 
\ldblquote too big to fail\rdblquote  are in trouble, central banks call on the government to bail them out with public funds. This encourages risk taking by the banks with the consequences at public expense.
\par In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board (which issues the dollars that have become the }{\b0\i de facto}{\b0  medium for international exchange) sets interest rates independently of any elected officials, as is also the case now with t
he Bank of England and the new European Central Bank.  They all have the same \ldblquote neo-
\par }\pard \s27\qj\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 liberal\rdblquote  economic philosophy as the FRB, the World Bank, and the IMF. 
\par }\pard \s27\qj\fi720\sa120\widctlpar\adjustright {\b0 Their \ldblquote scarce money\rdblquote  policies keep people unemployed because potential customers for the goods they w
