\par }{\tab Some of the leading businessmen and corporate executives of South Florida were gathered for a deluxe meal to hear a speaker who had flown down from New York City.  They were the favorite cu
stomers of a Florida banking chain which was their host at this event, he was the chief economist of a leading New York bank, and the stock market had recently reached an historic new high.
\par \tab The speaker predicted that in a matter of months the Dow would double\emdash 
and he was dead wrong. While almost all the experts then saw the market going up forever, it actually was teetering on the verge of a crash.  Soon it plummeted and South Florida was hit harder than most areas in the recession that followed.
\par \tab This occu
rred early in 1973, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke the 1,000 barrier for the first time, but it is only one example of how Wall Street bulls run riot whenever there is a record high.  Similar enthusiasm erupted, for example, after the DJIA reac
hed 9,000 early in April 1998, as there was talk that the Dow would rise to 12,000 in 18 months and double in ten years to 18,000.
\par \tab In 1973, the outcome was called correctly by only a handful of bearish forecasters, the best known of whom was Eliot Janeway}{\pard\plain \s28\qj\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\adjustright \v\fs22\expndtw-2\kerning20\cgrid {\xe {Janeway}}}{

\par \tab In the prevailing euphoria of 1973, economists generally did not expect the widespread unemployment of the 1974-75\page 
recession.  Their excuse for being wrong, in most cases, was that unanticipated events occurred, especially the Arab oil embargo and President Nixon}{\pard\plain \s28\qj\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\adjustright \v\fs22\expndtw-2\kerning20\cgrid

\par \tab Since life consists mostly of unanticipated events, forecasts and predictions always need to be viewed with skepticism.  News media habitually call on Wall Street \ldblquote experts\rdblquote  to explain daily stock market movements.  They
 sound as if they have three explanations prepared in advance: one if the market goes up, another if it goes down, and a third if there is no change.
\par \tab Financial analysts can always invent explanations for market behavior, but their predictions are as dubio
us as those of long-range weather forecasters.  While it may be disconcerting when the experts disagree about the economy, it can be even worse when they agree, because often they are all wrong.

 too hard to make up for it.  Like others in the social sciences, they tend to worship mathematical cleverness, forgetting the uncertainties that underlie their data.  They often seem unaware of a mathematical principle I learned in high school, an extens

 axiom.  The result of a calculation can never be any more exact than the least precise of the quantities that entered into it (that is, if a quantity correct to one decimal place is multiplied by another more precise quantity, the 
answer is still only correct to one decimal place).
\par \tab A good example of emphasizing math at the expense of the real world from which the numbers are taken comes from the experience of a doctoral student in a seminar at the University of North Carolina at Ch

\par \tab The professor, surprisingly, said the student should have \ldblquote suspended disbelief\rdblquote  and just verified the author\rquote s calculus.  The art

  It is available statistically in the form of median family income and median weekly wages and salaries.
\par \tab Another complication is that when a household has more wage-earners and/or people work longer hours, often taking more than one job at a time to make

Within this group, unlike a population that includes great extremes of income, the average (mean) is probably close to the median.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings in constant (1982) dollars, fell from $7.78 in 19

 welfare made up much less of the budget than people thought.  Total federal outlays, after excluding Social Security, amounted to $472 billion. The \ldblquote income security\rdblquote 
 category of $87 billion included $27 billion of federal employee retirement and disability that should not be considered welfare.  Taking that out, there was $60 billion of what might properly be described as welfare.
\par \tab Bottom line: all these \ldblquote income security\rdblquote  items, including housing assistance, food and nutrition, aid to families with depend

  There is not supposed to be any loss of tax revenue
s because previous high rates were assumed to have reduced incentive, so cutting the rates would cause people to make more money and pay more taxes even at lower rates.  The key to this argument is the so-called \ldblquote Laffer Curve.\rdblquote 
\par \tab Prof. Laffer used to doodle
 on napkins in restaurants, drawing a curve shaped like a mountain that was supposed to represent the amount of revenue from income tax.  At the left where the tax rate was zero the revenue would, of course, be zero, and at the right where the tax rate wa
s
 100% (so that nobody could earn any income without the government seizing it all) the revenue would be zero also.  The peak of the mountain represented the point where increasing the rate would so discourage effort that revenue would decrease as rates we
nt up.
\par \tab Laffer persuaded Reagan that rates were already beyond the high point of the curve so reducing rates would bring in more revenue by climbing backwards up the mountain.  Unfortunately, a four-trillion-dollar national debt had been amassed at the end 
of the trial.  This seemed to have convinced most experts that Laffer was wrong, but some apologists for the deficit years of the 1980s keep claiming it works.  In the 1996 vice-presidential TV debate

 boosted tax revenue to the government.  Tax receipts did rise during the 1980s, but the claim ignores inflation and fails to compare with a base period.

\par }\pard \s28\qj\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\adjustright {\tab Historically, little attention
 has been paid to the difference between a real profit and an increase in price that is due only to inflation. Taxes on ordinary income take no account of inflation because receipts and expenditures are all in the same year.  In the case of businesses, of
 course, inflation can have an effect on the valuation of inventories.
\par \tab Long-term capital gains (when the asset was owned for a holding period of, say, six months or a year) have been treated \page differently from ordinary income, being justified either to offs
et inflation or to provide an inducement to invest.  When an asset is sold, there is a capital gain if it brings more than it cost, and a capital loss if it is sold for less than it cost (allowing for improvements, expenses of sale, etc.).  How should the
se gains or losses affect one\rquote s taxes?
\par \tab Politics aside, there are questions of fairness.  What if the supposed gain is fictitious because the higher selling price merely reflects inflation?  Then the seller has gained no purchasing power from holding the as
set and should pay no tax. This was especially clear to many people when required to pay tax on selling their homes.
\par \tab As so often happens, Congress dealt with this in response to political pressure rather than logic. Instead of providing an inflation adjus
tment, they enacted complex rules that enabled one to escape tax on the gain by always trading up to a higher-priced home\emdash 
a solution approved by the real estate lobby. For many years this largely removed the problem for homeowners, until the 1997 law provided a more general exemption.
\par \tab A Republican plan was offered to address the problem for other assets by phasing in an adjustment for inflation}{\pard\plain \s28\qj\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\adjustright \v\fs22\expndtw-2\kerning20\cgrid {\xe {inflation}}}{
, and it hard to see why anyone should object to this.  On the other hand, if there is a real gain after adjustment for inflation, such income should be taxed at the same rate as \ldblquote ordinary income,\rdblquote 
 which includes interest, dividends, salaries, and workers wages, as well as profits of unincorporated businesses.  Fairness would seem to require the same tax rates for all kinds of income.

 deduction.  There apparently was a revenue reason, however, and for some 60 years there has been a limit (currently $3,000) that can be deducted in one year, with provisions to apply any excess to certain past and/or future years.
\par \page }{\i Tax changes over the years
\par }{\tab 
The first tax on capital gains, enacted in 1921, was effectively 40% of the tax on ordinary income.  Capital loss limitations were started in the 1930s.  In the 1950s and 1960s capital gains on assets held for more than six months were taxed at 50% of
 the tax on ordinary income.  Capital loss deductions were limited to $1,000 in any tax year.
\par  \tab These tax provisions remained remarkably stable for decades until the turmoil following the Arab oil embargo and OPEC price shocks.  Conservatives would have pr
eferred the former British practice of no tax at all on gains, while liberals would have preferred the tax on earned and unearned income to be the same.  Other inequities existed that were hardly ever discussed.
\par \tab Beginning in 1970, only 50% of long-term lo
sses were deductible.  The 1976 Tax Reform Act closed a loophole that allowed appreciated assets to be passed to heirs without taxing the gain (but this was repealed in 1980).  The Revenue Act of 1978 (Steiger Amendment) reduced the effective top rate fro
m
 49% to 28% on long-term capital gains.  Beginning in 1978, long-term capital gains were taxed at only 40% of ordinary income (losses still deductible at 50%), and the annual limit on losses was increased to $3,000.  The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 
further reduced the long-term maximum rate to 20%.
\par \tab The Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed the favorable treatment of long-term capital gains, treating all capital gains as ordinary income.  An exception was made in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, that 
excludes 50% of gain on small business stock issued after August 10, 1993.
\par \tab I was astonished when the bi-partisan 1986 tax bill provided for full taxation of capital gains, a proposal that had failed even during liberal administrations.  The capital gains 
change must have been a political trade-off for taking away some of the favorite deductions of the middle class, such as interest paid, state taxes, and various employee expenses.  As Republicans agitated to repeal the capital gains change, they made no o
ffer to restore the deductions taken away from the middle class.
\par \page \tab Although, generally speaking, the distinction between long and short-term gains became meaningless, Form 1040 still required them to be reported separately.  The holding period was one year,
 except that for assets acquired after June 22, 1984, and before 1988 it was six months.
\par \tab In 1997 the law was amended to require a holding period of 18 months, while reducing the maximum rate to 20%, with complicated transition rules}{\pard\plain \s28\qj\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\adjustright \v\fs22\expndtw-2\kerning20\cgrid

Capital gains have always offered advantages to the wealthy that applied even under the 1986 law when the rate was the same as for ordinary income: they continued to be able to avoid paying tax on appreciated ass
ets either by donating them to a charity (with the contribution counted at the higher value) or leaving them to their heirs.  (The latter loophole having been closed in 1976 but reopened in 1980.)  These advantages were not affected by the 1997 law.

\par \tab There
 has also been a less obvious advantage for the wealthy whenever capital gains are taxed less than earned income.  You can benefit from the lower rate on capital gains only if you gain more than you lose because losses have to be offset against gains, but
 small investors typically are lucky to break even.  Thus the tax law favors the winners over the losers in the stock market, and, by definition, the wealthy are the winners in the economic contests of life.
\par \tab Conservatives would, of course, prefer to pay little or no tax on capital gains but find it hard to counter the liberals\rquote 
 argument that income from inherited wealth should bear the same tax burden as income earned by mental and/or physical work.  The
\par \page argument they fall back on is that the tax savings from lower capital gains rates will be used for further investment that will be good for the economy, as proclaimed in the \ldblquote Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act\rdblquote 
 of the 1994 Republican \ldblquote Contract with America.\rdblquote 
\par \tab Unfortunately for that theory, the record shows that most of those who profited from tax cuts in the 1980s didn\rquote 
t invest in building U.S. industry.  Instead, they invested abroad, engaged in financial speculation, or bought U.S. government bonds.  A better way to stimulate investment and job creation
 would be to encourage small independent businesses, who have been shown to be much more effective for new products and new jobs than the corporate giants.  That could be done by appropriate tax incentives and by enforcing the anti-monopoly laws to protec
t small business from unfair competition.

One argument against corporate income tax is that stockholders are taxed twice.  When the profits that have already been taxed at the corporate level are distributed
 as dividends, the stockholder is taxed again.  This objection is quite valid, but political solutions, as usual, attack the problem in the wrong ways.  For many years prior to the 1986 tax revision, taxpayers were allowed to exclude some dividends from t
heir taxable income.  Also, over the years, there has been considerable reduction of the corporate income tax, partly by rate reductions and partly by rules changes.

\ldblquote liberals who see a flat tax as regressive are wrong.\rdblquote 
\par \tab If you think this sounds too good to be true, you are right, for the following reasons:
\par \tab 1. Politicians will never enact this scheme, whatever their party, because they are all under obligation because of campaign contributions and other favors to protect the loopholes of their benefactors.  They might pass something with the title of 
\ldblquote flat tax,\rdblquote  but it would be as phony as the \ldblquote tax reform\rdblquote  of 1986.
\par \tab 2. Even if the flat tax could be enacted, total income without deductions or write-offs is not a simple concept.  Most of the over five million words in the tax code have nothing to 
do with people who live on wages and salaries.  They have to do with how business and investment income are calculated.  Take an example:
\par \tab Suppose you own a store.  If you collect $1,000,000 from your customers, that is not your income.  Perhaps you had to
 pay 80% of that to your suppliers for the merchandise, so you keep $200,000. But you also have to pay rent, insurance, local taxes, wages to employees, etc., so you could be very lucky to have $100,000 left.  Paying 19% of the million dollars ($190,000) 
would put you into bankruptcy!  The place that loopholes are created\emdash not usually by accident, but by lobbying power\emdash is in the rules for what is to be included or deducted in figuring taxable net income.
\par \tab 3. It gets even more complicated for the corporate income tax, which brings up the valid argument already discussed against \page double taxation (of corporate income and of stockholders\rquote  dividends).  Income is not simple and obvious.
\par \tab 4. That $20,000 exemption for everyone would lose purchasing power over time unless increased to offset inflation.
\par \tab 5. While a flat tax, if a fair one could be enacted, would be roughly proportional rather than regressive, the sum of all taxes (federal, state and local of all kinds) bears most heavily on people of ordinary means and
 is therefore regressive.  When the federal income tax is somewhat progressive, as intended, it helps to balance the regressive nature of other taxes.
\par \tab 6. Some of the same politicians who favor a flat income tax also have been recommending a value added}{\pard\plain \s28\qj\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\adjustright \v\fs22\expndtw-2\kerning20\cgrid {\xe {valueadded}}}{ tax}{\pard\plain

The giving of low-income taxpayers is all the more impressive because there is no tax benefit unless contributions combined with other itemized deductions total more than the standard deduction. This usually means that people with modest incomes can 
get no benefit unless they have mortgage interest and real estate taxes to itemize.

d, then FM at first was almost commercial-free, and the early days of television had long programs with a single sponsor whose commercials came at the beginning and the end.  The big increase occurred after the Reagan administration in its enthusiasm for 
deregulation had the FCC remove the already generous limit on the number of commercials, saying it was not necessary because broadcasters were using less than the limit.
\par \tab Further increases continued in the 1990s, according to an April 29, 1998, Associated Press report of a study commissioned by two advertising groups.  It found that prime time TV in November 1997 had over 11 minutes of commercials per hour, \page 
compared with about 9 1/2 minutes six years earlier, and network promotions plus public service annou
ncements brought the total clutter to more than 15 minutes per hour.  The ads had grown shorter but there were more of them.  In daytime television there were nearly 20 minutes of interruptions per hour.
\par \tab An agency spokesman said the networks had to increa
se the advertising carried to keep up their revenues because of a decrease in viewers.  The industry has discussed many theories to explain the loss of viewers, but seems unwilling to think it could be at least partly due to advertising saturation and/or 
the decline in quality of programming.

I had begun doing my own count of the ads and promotional spots on the early evening half-hour news shows of three networks in February 1995, which I repeated at the same time of the year in 19
96, 1998, and 1999.  I found that the viewer had to endure more than one ad for each minute of news.  In 1995 and 1996 these ads and announcements averaged 29% of the total time, which grew to 37% in 1998 and 1999, leaving only 63% for actual news.

 and electric power utilities.  When Ma Bell was broken up, it was wisecracked that the courts targeted the only monopoly that was working well. AT&T kept introducing impr
ovements and long-distance rates kept coming down because federal regulation prevented overcharging.
\par \tab The pressure to break up AT&T came from large corporations who wanted faster introduction of sophisticated services.  It is uncertain whether rates would 
have come down as much from scientific progress without competition from MCI, Sprint, and others.  Many consumers have found the conflicting claims, deceptive promotional gimmicks, and barrage of advertising an unnecessary addition to the confusion of mod
ern life.  After AT&T\rquote s monopoly of telephone service was broken, a \page 
competitive war broke out for the long-distance telephone business. Although MCI and Sprint offered the biggest challenge to AT&T, many small companies vied for a piece of the business.
\par \tab O
ne outcome was an annoying snarl in the routing of calls.  As numbers became depleted in various area codes, due to demand for cellular phone and fax lines as well as population growth, parts of each area had to be switched to a new area code. Some long d
istance calls were not getting through to the new codes.
\par \tab For example, the North Carolina Piedmont Triad (Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point) had to change from area code 919 to 910 in 1993 and change again to 336 at the end of 1997.  Both times resi
dents found that calls directed to the new area code were resulting in such messages as \ldblquote Your call cannot be completed as dialed.\rdblquote 
  A BellSouth spokesman explained in a newspaper interview that multiple phone companies are involved and each must reprogram 
its computers to recognize the new area code.  He gave the example of a New York City call first handled by NYNEX, passed to a long-distance company, and then relayed to BellSouth in Greensboro.  If any company in the chain had not reprogrammed its equipm
ent, the call would not go through.
\par \tab There were 34 new area codes created in North America in 1997, requiring adjustments by the hundreds of local, long-distance, and cellular companies, as well as thousands of private telephone systems.  There is a grace p
eriod of several months when the old area code will still work.  The assurance given by a telephone company spokesman sounded a little weak: \ldblquote

\par \tab Most HMOs, like most hospitals and the Blue Cross organizations, began as non-profit services. State statutes initially prohibited HMOs from being profit-making 
businesses, and the federal HMO Act of 1973 provided grants only to nonprofit HMOs.  Little known to the general public, the HMOs, by the mid-1980s, had obtained laws in every state except Minnesota to allow HMOs to be run for profit and in some cases to 
allow non-profits to convert to for-profit businesses.

The British government, in the late 1980s, allowed workers to put part of their pension contributions into p
ersonal pension accounts while still paying into a government basic plan that provides about $100 a week minimum pension.  Encouraged by a government media campaign and private financial promotions, millions chose the partial privatization, and millions s

?  Because prices and wages tend to rise and fall together, inflation is really immaterial to those who neither owe money nor have fixed investments.  Debtors benefit by 
paying off loans in depreciated dollars, until they borrow again and have to pay higher interest rates. Inflation causes bonds to lose value (especially long-term bonds), but investors who have learned to diversify may offset this by gains in their \page 
stock portfolios.  Retirees are hurt by inflation if they depend only on annuities and/or bonds at fixed rates and if pensions are not adjusted for cost of living.
\par \tab Inflation has been called the \ldblquote cruelest tax,\rdblquote  supposedly most harmful to the poor.  However, the 
prices paid by the poor rise neither faster nor slower during inflation than the prices paid by others.  The poor have been hurt when welfare payments failed to keep pace with inflation.  The poor and middle-class working families suffered when inflation 
outran adjustments in income tax exemptions, but much more costly to them have been the joblessness and the difficulty of repaying debt resulting from the FRB\rquote s cure for inflation.
\par \tab For people with investments, however, inflation means paying higher taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains because the tax rates are not adjusted for inflation.  As Blinder put it in 1987: \ldblquote Inflation is indeed a cruel tax\emdash

 almost any time.  The U.S., however, has often paid an exorbitant price in unemployment and lost production to avoid inflation (over one trillion dollars of GNP in 1982-86, by Blinder\rquote 
s estimate).  The economists of the banking system, though, have long regarded inflation as a much greater threat than unemployment.  Whenever employment improves, they go into a panic over fears of inflation.

workers will fear less for their jobs and may successfully ask for wage increases, which their employers will pass on to their customers in higher prices, and that, of course, is inflation.
\par \page 
\par \tab Economists recognize two theories of inflation: demand-pull (too much money chasing too few goods) and cost-push (wages, raw materials, and/or profits rising faster than production), and both could possibly be occurring at the same time.
\par \tab The demand-pull theory only makes sense when the factors of production are fully
 utilized.  It is characterized by shortages of goods and backlogs of orders.  Since the 1970s the U.S. economy has been characterized by considerable excess capacity and numerous plant closings, while actual unemployment has greatly exceeded the official
 tally, so the theory doesn\rquote t seem to apply to this recent period.
\par \tab The cost-push theory, on the other hand, explains the inflation of the 1970s that subsided in 1982.  It wasn\rquote t, as some would say, due to powerful unions forcing wages up too much, nor was 
it due to sudden spurts in corporate profits.  Clearly, the push came from a drastic rise in cost of raw materials, specifically petroleum.  Since then, there has been none of the double-digit inflation that was so worrisome then, nor have workers been ab
le to force wages up because labor unions have grown weaker and weaker.

\par \page \tab Of course, the CPI is imperfect, as are other vital economic measures such as GNP, the balance of payments, and even the federal deficit, but for economic analysis we use them, lacking a
ny better measures.  They need to be calculated consistently by non-political experts, such as the BLS, which has calculated the CPI for half a century, not by Congress.
\par \tab Looking for cover on a politically sensitive issue, Congress set up a commission in J
une 1995 to recommend changes in the CPI, but all the economists appointed had already said the CPI was too high. The panel announced its findings in mid-September without conducting any original research, and, to nobody\rquote 
s surprise, reached the same conclu
sion its members had previously expressed at congressional hearings.  It was as if a jury were picked from people who had all previously declared themselves in favor of a guilty verdict.  Economists who differed, some pointing out that elderly pensioners 
experience higher than average price increases in such areas as out-of-pocket medical expense, were excluded from the commission.
\par \tab The usual arguments for the CPI overstatement position involve substitute goods, discount stores, quality improvements, and re
duction of prices on new products.  Their logic breaks down when these factors are closely examined.  If consumers substitute cheaper and less desired products, such as hamburger for steak, the products should not be considered equal.  Likewise, when cust
omers switch to discount stores that offer less service, their money does not buy as much satisfaction.
\par \tab The CPI already includes extensive adjustments for product quality even though consumers often have no choice about new features, while quality deterior

 gives the \ldblquote choice\rdblquote

 conspired, as was later proved, to create a false scarcity and long lines of motorists at the gas pumps.  The resulting public panic enabled them to further increase prices, trim costs by introducing self-service, and add extra profits

 was abetted by bankers, who normally regard inflation with great dread, especially whenever wages rise or unemp
loyment falls.  The bankers made loans to less developed countries for purchases of oil at inflated OPEC prices.  Because money from OPEC profits was flowing into the banks and being loaned out for more oil purchases, this process was sometimes called 
\ldblquote recycling.\rdblquote   Two harmful results were (1) fueling inflation and (2) debt burdens on the borrowing countries.
\par \tab If it had been left to the market mechanism of supply and demand, the oil producing countries would have had to reduce their cartel\rquote s prices or be un
able to sell their oil.  Instead, the banks made high-risk loans to finance high-priced oil purchases that enabled OPEC}{\pard\plain \s28\qj\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\adjustright \v\fs22\expndtw-2\kerning20\cgrid {\xe {OPEC}}}{

\par \tab Why did banks make loans that appeared, on the face of them, so imprudent?  For one thing, the interest rates they charged were extremely remunerative, and for another, banks take the attitude that nations don\rquote 
t go bankrupt; no matter how bad their financial situation, they can always get more money from taxes.  At those interest rates, the banks would be content to roll the loans over and just keep collecting the interest.  In some cases 
foreign loans have specific government guarantees.  If not, banks tend to rely on their belief that the public will be forced to bail them out in the end, as in the case of the savings and loan fiasco.

its (checking accounts).  They also did commercial lending, could accept time deposits (savings accounts) and lend to homeowners against mortgages.
\par \tab The S&Ls were created to make more funds available to finance home purchases, using funds deposited in savi
ngs accounts by individuals.  Savings banks grew up in the northeastern states, and were non-profit mutual associations operating much like savings and loans.  The thrift institutions were allowed by the government to pay slightly higher interest than the
 commercial banks.
\par \tab Two things changed: (1) non-profit mutual thrifts were allowed to be converted to private corporations and become part of the corporate merger movement; and (2) restrictions on their operations were relaxed, largely in response to the pr
essures they felt from rapidly rising interest rates after the oil shocks.  As market interest rates soared, S&Ls were at a disadvantage in competing for deposits against other investment opportunities such as bank certificates of deposit (CDs), bonds, st
ocks, and mutual funds.  The home mortgages they had written at fixed rates before interest rates soared produced little revenue and lost market value for resale.
\par \tab The unrealized losses of the S&Ls had reached $200 billion by 1982, according to Quirk and Bridwell (1992), but they wrote: \ldblquote Even if the government had to buy all the outstanding\page

\v\fs22\expndtw-2\kerning20\cgrid {\xe {acquisitions}}}{ that I did as a doctoral candidate.
\par \tab The doctoral research aime
d to measure the factors that influence how soon a company becomes acquired.  It showed that among firms acquired from 1972 through 1976, acquisition tended to come sooner when: (1) managerial economies were available as indicated by lower profitability (
before interest and taxes) than the \page 
weighted average of its industry; (2) potential increase in stock value was indicated by lower price-earnings ratio than industry average; and (3) there had been an increase in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) over the previous three years.

\par \tab Statistical measures showed significance of the model as a whole to be well above the 99% confidence level.  When the model was tested to see how well it would have predicted results in the next two years, 1977 and 1978, the 
error was about as small as that of the original sample.
\par \tab An adaptation of this academic model, eliminating industrial categories where there were no acquisitions in recent years (presumably because of industry concentration that would arouse antitrust con
cern), was able to select stocks for each of the seven years 1977-83 that gained an average of 31.4% each year, not counting dividends, compared with 7.3% for the Standard & Poor\rquote s 500 Stock Index.
\par \tab When the same formula was used to select stocks for purchase at the beginning of 1984, however, their performance by year-end was only about a break-even result.  This was not just because Standard & Poor\rquote 
s 500-stock index ended the year with only a tenth of a point gain; there were years of decline in the earli
er period when the model was successful.  In my opinion, it was due to the change of behavior in the merger market.  As the promoters of mergers and acquisitions developed confidence that antitrust administrators would look the other way, they changed the
ir criteria for selecting targets, emphasizing opportunities to enhance profits by eliminating competition.

\par \tab The immunity of organized baseball from antitrust challenges has allowed the American and National Leagues to limit expansion and the owners to hold communities to ransom.  To have a major league team they have been compelled to furn

At the risk of over-simplification, one could say that for most of their histories the Republican party reflected the interests of the industrial North while Democrats were the party of the agricu
ltural South.  Although farmers, from time to time, have felt a desire for tariff and/or quota protection against foreign agricultural products, they built up a fierce resentment against high prices of manufactured goods they needed due to tariffs on thos
e products.  Northern industrialists, of course, favored tariffs that handicapped foreign competition against their products, often joined by their employees who feared for their jobs if imports captured the market.
\par \tab Several things changed.  The South, whic
h had been solidly Democratic for generations, began switching to the Republicans when white Southerners were cultivated as a Nixon political strategy.  Farm support for free trade weakened as factory farming displaced large numbers of farmers.  Corporati
o
ns, which generally had lobbied for high tariffs on consumer goods competing with their products and low tariffs on the raw materials they imported, found all tariffs a burden as they combined into multinational empires.  The corporate trend toward global
 markets caused business elements in the Republican party to lobby against trade barriers.
\par \page 
\par \tab Business interests also influenced the Democrats, but opposition to NAFTA came mainly from Democrats with labor union backing and from Perot\rquote s independent Reform P
arty.  Historically, labor unions have been spotty in their attitude toward trade barriers.  Philosophically, they often have favored free trade to bring down consumer prices, but when they perceived a barrier as necessary to protect jobs in a particular 
industry they sided with owners to demand protection.

reforms of the past have seemed impossible and took a long time to accomplish.  Often it seems that things don\rquote t get fixed until they get really bad. The \ldblquote economic royalists,\rdblquote 
 as FDR called them, had created many problems that culminated in the 1929 stock 
market crash and the Great Depression. Only when it got that bad did the public ignore the editorial advice of the overwhelming majority of newspapers and elect a new President and Congress.

  FDR was credited with saving the nation from a radical revolution.  Important among the reforms of the Roosevelt administration was the SEC, enforc
