            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In
                a diverse political world, living among billions of people, you
                may ask what one person can do politically to change the world
                we live in to make it a better place, one where human beings
                can live in harmony with each other and with nature? But you
                are not alone. Many others feel as you do. You can reach out
                and make contact with them; you can educate other people who
                are as yet unaware of the problems and the issues, and you can
                live a good life and be an example to others. </font>

                    Political Action </b></font></font>
            <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If
                you are lucky, you live in one of the world's liberal democracies.
                By liberal democracy, I mean a political form of government where
                leaders are elected by popular vote, and where human rights are
                honored. Since 1950, the world has seen a phenomenal growth of
                democracies, from 22 nations representing 31% of the world's
                population, to 120 electoral democracies representing 58% of
                the world's people. </font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> That's
                a shift of historic importance, but it's not enough. 72 sovereign
                nations representing 42% of the world's people still have no
                representative government. If you are a citizen of one of these
                nations, working for democracy is an important first step towards
                creating social justice and a sustainable world economy. If you
                are a citizen of one of the newer democracies, you may have a
                democratically elected government, but few or even no recognized
                human rights, or your democracy and human rights may rest on
                fragile foundations. </font>
            <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defending
                human rights is an important step to making your democracy a
                liberal democracy, where those rights are observed and respected.
                But if you are a member of a long-established liberal democracy,
                you can't rest, either. You must work hard to keep your elections
                honest and your rights from being abused, for there are powerful
                interests that benefit from restricting human rights and corrupting
                democratic institutions even in the oldest liberal democracies.
                It can truly be said that a good citizen's political work is
                never done, and he or she must be vigilant both to create a better
                world and to sustain it. </font>
            <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The
                forces that concentrate wealth and power into a few hands and
                that abuse the earth's environment for their own benefit oppose
                democratic reforms, social justice, human rights, and efforts
                to create a sustainable local economy. Their goal is to block
                genuine democratic institutions, manipulate elections, limit
                human rights, and use the environment for their short-sighted
                interest--to gain wealth and hold onto power. Opposing them requires
                that we become aware of their efforts and block them through
                democratic actions that include: 1) Organizing opposition; 2)
                Educating others and demonstrating against wrongs; and 3) Voting
                against those wrongs and those who support them; or taking legal
                action—enforcing human rights—to stop them. </font>

            <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Getting
                started involves understanding what you can or cannot do within
                your existing political system. If some of the suggestions I
                offer are impossible to do under your form of government, consider
                them as goals to be reached, and work to change your political
                circumstances so that you have the right as a citizen to exercise
                them. </font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If
                you are a citizen of a democracy, register to vote and vote often.
                Your vote does matter—consider the recent American election where
                the President of the United States, now perhaps the single most
                powerful political office in the world, was chosen by a difference
                of 537 votes in one state. Check out the candidates' records
                and vote for those who reflect your values. Join a political
                party that reflects your values, or create one if none exists.
                Volunteer for candidates you support, doing what you can do to
                help. Write letters to your local newspaper supporting your candidate;
                attend the candidate's meetings and express your concerns. Donate
                your time and money if you can. </font>
            <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Help
                keep your political system honest by working as a poll-watcher
                and monitor the counting of ballots. Help those who are illiterate
                to read their ballots and exercise their privilege to vote. Support
                efforts to keep balloting both secret and honest—creating a trustworthy
                voting system generates trust in democracy, while distrust undermines
                all efforts to choose democratically and govern justly, and forces
                people either to resort to violence against regimes or into sullen
                withdrawal from the political system altogether. </font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Become
                involved in local community organizations that reflect your agenda.
                Check your area for these organizations, going to newspapers,
                libraries, or public meetings to find them. If none exist, then
                consider creating your own local organization. Work with local
                people to clean up your local environment, create more parks
                and people-friendly environments, to support public transportation,
                protect civil rights, elect responsible local and national officials,
                and fight pollution and unwanted corporate intrusion. Work to
                educate your community through letters, newsletters, organized
                events, and demonstrations. </font>
            <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Link
                your local organizations with regional organizations or the local
                organizations in other communities to examine your region's problems
                and work for solutions. Problems like local peace or a cleaner
                environment often rely on regional solutions rather than local
                ones. If, as sometimes happens, you run into competing interests
                between communities over jobs, water rights, ethnic conflicts
                or other issues, work to resolve them. It's important that you
                settle your differences in a peaceful and fair manner, respecting
                and honoring all the parties involved to prevent future conflict.
                Seek justice, not vengeance. </font>
            <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Link
                your regional organizations with national and international organizations.
                Get involved with national and international organizations and
                work to show local and regional groups that involvement on the
                national and international level are also important to create
                social justice and a sustainable environment locally and regionally.
                International organizations can help deal with crucial large-scale
                issues like world peace, globabalization, immigration, and global
                warming that no one nation or region can solve alone. Support
                candidates and parties that advance your efforts and work for
                positive changes. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Become
                an involved citizen. Learn about the issues, live a moral life
                and be an example yourself to others. Get involved locally, regionally,
                nationally, and internationally in efforts that promote peace
                and justice, protect natural environments, and build sustainable
                local economies. Your efforts will make you both a good citizen
                of your state and a person of the earth. </font></p>
